walking, no books."</p>

<p>We met in Guy's chambers, and talked Cornwall;
but the trouble was with the Bookworm,
who wanted to take a truck-load of books with
him.</p>

<p>We decided on going to Penzance, and then
rambling just where we would. A visit to the
land of a lost language attracted the Bookworm,
who at once added a few score books to be read
on the spot.</p>

<p>Guy was appointed guardian of the common
purse, and empowered to make all arrangements.</p>

<p>The books were left behind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A splendid day in August we had for our
run westward. The Bookworm had a corner,
and by-and-by the spirit of wonder crept over
him as he looked at the blue skies and the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
grass. There was a world outside of books,
after all.</p>

<p>"Here's the briny! Out with your head,
man, and suck it all in; it's the wine of life,"
shouted Guy.</p>

<p>Up went all the blinds, and down went all the
windows, and every one who could gazed upon
the blue sea shoaling into green with white-flaked
edging on the frizzling sands. It is the custom
to pay this homage to the sea for being good
enough to be just where it is, between Starcross
and Teignmouth. Right and left, the Bookworm
saw heads thrust out and faces in ecstasy, as
though the whole human freight of the flying
train was in rapt adoration. White handkerchiefs
waved, and the pure voices of children
trilled spontaneous anthems whenever the vexatious
tunnels permitted them to gaze upon old
England's symbol of power and freedom. It
was a new experience to the Bookworm, and it
surprised him that anything not printed and
stitched and bound should stir so much emotion.
It was Nature's book in red sandstone and blue
sea illuminated by the sun, on which his tired
eyes rested for a few moments; he felt refreshed
by the mere vision, his pulses throbbing with
new sensations. And when the vision passed in
the broad valley of the Teign, he asked simply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is there more of this?"</p>

<p>"Plenty," said Guy, promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Guy's account, we were to have
just whatever we liked, when we liked, and where
we liked. Seascape and moorscape, hill and vale,
sailing and fishing, riding and driving, and golfing,
and all that sort of thing. And then there
were certain mysterious regions where we were
to find tracks of the fairies, and come across odds
and ends of things, and people too. We were not
to have any guide-books; he insisted on that.
What was the good of guide-books to fellows on
their rambles? Who cared how many yards he
was from anywhere, or how many miles it was
from one place to another? All that was worth
remembering could be picked up on the spot, and
then there wouldn't be any danger of everything
running into one blurred outline of travel, just as
happened to a fellow after tramping for weeks
through picture-galleries and curio-shops, and all
that sort of thing. Guy said he knew a fellow
who did the whole county most thoroughly guide-book
in hand. He started from Bude, and did
the north coast; and then he turned around and
did the south coast. He scored his guide-book
like a chart of navigation, and his marginal
notes played leap-frog all over the show.
When he got to Plymouth he lost the precious
book, and if it wasn't for railway labels and
hotel bills, he wouldn't have known where he'd
been.</p>

<p>A commercial man, having totted up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
accounts, seemed greatly interested in Guy's
remarks, and glided into the conversation. He
told us he hadn't had a holiday for thirty years,
and never expected another in this life. He
became quite confidential, and gave us his views
about happiness in the world to come. He
never intended going "on the road" again for
a living in the next world, he said, if there
were any telephones about. He didn't like
telephones when the boss was always at the
other end.</p>

<p>We ran through the apple country, and the
commercial man said these orchards were simply
nothing to be compared with those a few miles
away, where the real Devon cider was made.
He told some funny stories about cider and its
makers&mdash;the way in which sweet cider was discovered,
and the hand that Old Nick had in the
matter.</p>

<p>"It's a short story," said he, good-naturedly.
"Old John Bowden had the finest orchard land
in South Devon, and it appears that in the
olden times the land was the property of
Tavistock Abbey, and the good Fathers used
to come over every season to make cider and
have a frolic. Sometimes the good old cider,
being no respecter of persons, got into the good
Fathers' heads. Now, you must know that the
best of cider is a trifle sharp to the palate&mdash;the
natives call it 'rough'&mdash;and the Fathers were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the habit of toning some rare good stuff, reserved
for high days and holidays, in empty wine-casks.
One season, the wine-casks falling short, the
Abbot of Tavistock drew up a sort of prize
competition, like the magazines do now, offering
something tasty to the inventor of a process for
making 'rough' cider sweet without the use of
wine, which, I suppose, worked out expensive,
and, moreover, encouraged more drinking than
was allowed under the tippling act. I must now
tell you that, for a very long time, things hadn't
gone on smoothly between the monks of Tavistock
Abbey and Old Nick, who was constantly
prowling about the premises, picking up little
bits of information, and making the good Fathers
uncomfortable. Well, he chanced upon this prize
competition notice on an old door covered over
with cast horse-shoes and vermin nailed up for
'good luck' and to keep his satanic majesty off
the premises. However, there he was, and read
the notice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i017"></a>
<img src="images/i_017.jpg" width="400" height="518" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FATHER JOHN AND THE CIDER.</div>
</div>

<p>"A very obliging little old man turned up
at the orchards one season, and offered his
services, and was taken in to do odd jobs about
the pound-house, and as he wasn't particular
about his bed, he was allowed to curl himself
up in one of the big empty cider-casks. In truth,
after the work was over for the day, the good
Fathers had other fish to fry, and thought no
more about him; but the strange workman was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
most busy when he was supposed to be sound
asleep.</p>

<p>"Of all the Fathers of the Abbey, Brother
John was the keenest on winning the prize
for turning 'rough' cider into sweet, and he
spent hours in the pound-house alone, spoiling
good stuff, without getting one foot forrarder.
'Dang my old buttons!' said he, after another
failure.</p>

<p>"It wasn't so much the language as the
temper of Brother John which attracted the
notice of the little old man who slept in the cask,
and he whispered something which made the
good brother turn pale and tremble in his shoes.
He was not above temptation, it is true, but he
was a brave man for all that, and dissimulated
so well that the stranger was so off his guard
as to sleep in his cask and leave one of his cloven
feet sticking out of the bung-hole. Brother
John bided his time and covered the bung-hole,
and then arranged for such a flow of cider into
the cask upon the sleeping stranger as to settle
his hash, unless it was the very old Nick himself.
Old Nick it was, and when he awoke to the
situation he was so hot with passion that the
cider bubbled in the cask, and he disappeared,
leaving the strongest of strong smell of brimstone
behind. Brother John kept the secret to himself,
not knowing what might come of it; but when
he tasted the cider his eyes sparkled, for it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
as sweet as honey, and when sweet cider was
wanted at the Abbey, he used to pour it 'rough'
upon the fumes of burning sulphur, and, lo and
behold! it became sweet. It was Old Nick who
gave away the secret to Brother John, who was
smart enough to learn it. A Devon man calls
sweet cider 'matched,' on account of its connection
with old Brimstone."</p>

<p>"Did Brother John patent the process?"
asked Guy.</p>

<p>"No, he didn't, though Old Nick tempted
him; but Brother John was too wide awake to
have his fingers burnt by patent lawyers and
their agents."</p>

<p>"Is that story in print?" asked the Bookworm,
preparing to make a note for future
reference.</p>

<p>"I should say not. It's just one of those
trifles you pick up on the road. Plenty about
when Old Nick is concerned. They say his
majesty didn't cross the Tamar in olden days;
or, if he did, then he hopped back again in
double-quick time. That may be, but he's a
season ticket-holder now, and has good lodgings,
and I ought to know, for I do business all
through the country," said the man of samples,
stepping out of the carriage.</p>

<p>"A trifle rough on us lawyers," said Guy.
"Poor beggar has suffered, I suppose."</p>

<p>Across the bridge, and we are in the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of pasties and cream&mdash;the land of a lost language,
of legend and romance, where the old seems
new and the new seems old, and the breath of
life everywhere.</p>

<p>Penzance.</p>

The</span> proper thing to do when you
awake at Penzance is to run
down to the sea and bathe. We
were told all about it in the
smoking-room. It is a sort of
ceremony with something belonging
to it. When once you've bathed in the
sea you're free of the country, like the Israelites,
after swimming the Jordan. Everybody asks
his neighbour, "Have you bathed?" If you
have, it's all right.</p>

<p>We missed the Bookworm soon after breakfast,
but Guy said we would soon find him if we
drew the libraries. Guy supposed that reading
was like dram-drinking to a fellow who had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
himself into the Bookworm's condition, and it
would be just as well to let him have a dose
occasionally. We decided to "do" Penzance on
our own account.</p>

<p>There's nothing much to "do." All the
streets run down to the sea, and then run up
again. It is a capital arrangement and saves
one asking questions. It is humiliating for a
Londoner to be seen asking his way about, and
takes the fine bloom off his swagger not to be
able to find his way to the next street, in a town
all the inhabitants of which could be put into
one corner of the Crystal Palace. Guy said he'd
rather walk miles than ask such a silly question.</p>

<p>Penzance had a reputation long before any
modern rivals were heard of, and was the Madeira
of England before the Riviera made its <i>début</i> as
a professional beauty in the sunny south. Professional
beauties want "touching up" sometimes,
and Penzance has been doing a little in that way
lately, though without destroying the charm
which draws admirers, and keeps them. It is
one of those towns in which you seem to be
always walking in the shadow of a long yesterday.
Go into the market, and buy a rib of beef, and
you are brought face to face with an ancient
cross whose age no man can surely tell. You
buy a fish, still panting, from the creel of a
wrinkled specimen of human antiquity which
takes snuff, and bargains in unfamiliar words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Shops with modern frontages are filled with dark
serpentine, which carries you back to geologic
time; and at the photographers, the last professional
beauty on the stage is surrounded by
monuments in stone, weathered and hoary before
the Druids used them for mystic rites. And the
names are strange. A sound of bitter wailing is
in Marazion, and Market Jew brings to mind the
lost ten tribes. You learn in time that Market
Jew has nothing to do with Jewry, nor Marazion
with lamentation; but all this comes gradually,
and there is ever the sensation of having an old
and vanished past always with you. You may
step from Alverton Street, Pall Mall and Piccadilly
rolled into one, with its motor-cars and
bikes, knickers and chiffons, into Market Jew,
reminding you of antiquity and gabardines, or
<i>vice versâ</i>, just as you happen to be taking your
walks abroad.</p>

<p>Penzance has one "lion"&mdash;Sir Humphry
Davy. Sir Humphry and his little lamp is a
story with immortal youth, like that of Washington
and his little hatchet. Sir Humphry meets
you at unexpected places and times&mdash;there was
something <i>à la</i> Sir Humphry on the breakfast
menu. We heard about him soon after our
arrival, from an American tourist of independent
views. He said that Sir Humphry would not
be a boss man now because he didn't know a
good thing when he had it, and gave away his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
invention in a spirit of benevolence, which was
destructive of all sound commercial principles.
Then he figured out how many millions, in
dollars, Sir Humphry might have made, if only
he had patented his little lamp and run the show
himself.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry is a sort of patron saint, and
some people feel all the better for looking at his
statue in marble outside the Market House. He
was born here, but his bones rest in peace at
Geneva. They may be brought over at the
centenary of his death, and canonized by the
miners, whose saint he is, and God reward him
for placing science at the service of humanity.</p>

<p>We found ourselves in the Morrab Gardens;
the Public Library is there, and Guy said we
might surprise the Bookworm if he came out to
breathe. We didn't see him, but we saw the
gardens&mdash;a little paradise with exotic blooms,
and fountains playing, and the air laden with
perfume. We sat down, but didn't feel like
talking&mdash;a delicious, do-nothing sort of feeling
was over us. We didn't know then what it was,
but found that it was the climate&mdash;the restful,
seductive climate.</p>

<p>A couple of fishwomen with empty baskets
passed us, and they talked loud enough, but it
might have been Arabic for all we knew. The
letters of the alphabet seemed to be waltzing with
the s's and z'z to the old women's accompaniment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and words reached us from a distance like the
hum of bees. We were inclined to sleep, so
moved on; but the feeling while it lasted was
delicious. It may be only coincidence, but the
Bookworm discovered that Morrab is a Semitic
word, and means "the place of the setting sun."
The Morrab Gardens face the west; and to sit in
a library in a miniature garden of Eden with an
Arabic name is, in his opinion, the height of
human enjoyment. The natives think a lot of
the garden.</p>

<p>Serpentine and saints are common&mdash;the
former is profitable; but there was an over-production
of the latter a long time ago, and the
market is still inactive. Some parishes had more
than one saint, and some saints had more than
one <i>alias</i>, to the great confusion of all saint
lovers. The memory of saints, however, will last
as long as the Mount stands. The Mount, dedicated
to St. Michael, makes one curious about
the early history of the good people who came
here long ago, when the sea was salt enough to
float millstones. The cheapest way of coming
across in those days from the "distressful country,"
was to sit on a millstone and wait for a fair
breeze. The saints were quite ready to grind
any other man's corn as soon as they landed, and
the millstones were convenient for that purpose.
The rights of aliens to eat up natives were articles
of belief and practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Penzance appeared on the saints' charts as the
"Holy Headland," which was a mark to steer
by; but St. Michael, it appears, drifted out of his
course, and landed at the Mount, where the giant
lived, and thereby hangs a tale.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Michael and the Conger.</span></p>

<p>There are more St. Michaels than one, but the
hero of this story landed at the Mount in a fog.
The Mount was then the marine residence of an
ancient giant, well known as keeping a sharp
look-out for saints through a telescope, which he
stole from an unfortunate Ph&oelig;nician ship laden
with tin and oysters. The giant had an evil reputation,
but did nothing by halves. He was asleep
when St. Michael landed; and when he slept, he
snored, and when he snored, the Mount shook.</p>

<p>The poor saint was in a terrible funk, wandering
about for days, reading the notices which the
giant posted up warning saints not to land, unless
they wished to be cooked in oil, after the manner
of sardines. There was nothing to be picked up
just then but seaweed, and the dry bones which
the giant threw away&mdash;and there wasn't enough
on the bones to support a saint after he had done
with them. St. Michael had got rid of the very
last drop of the best LL. whisky, and sat on
the empty keg, and dreamed of his own peat fire
at Ballyknock, and the little shebeen where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
drop was to be had for the asking. It was fear
of the fierce giant above which alone kept him
from singing the poem which he had composed
about "Home, sweet home."</p>

<p>The saint was very sad, and had almost given
up hope, when something in the sea attracted his
attention, and he saw a great conger rise, tail
first, and stretch itself, until the tail topped the
rock. Its head remained in the sea. The giant
was snoring, and the Mount shook. St. Michael
was the gold medallist of his college, and could
put two and two together with the help of his
fingers. "A sign," said he, girding on his sword,
and putting on his best pair of spurs. The
conger was to be for him a Jacob's ladder.</p>

<p>So he dug his spurs well into the fish's side,
and climbed and climbed until he reached the
top, and, with one mighty stroke, cut off the
giant's head. There wasn't much personal
estate&mdash;only the telescope&mdash;and the saint took
that, but forgot to send a "return" to Somerset
House, and pay death duties. The conger
wagged his tail, by way of saying he was tired
and wanted to be off, so the saint slipped down
quite easily&mdash;so easily that he found the earth
hard when he touched bottom. Those who have
eyes to see may see the mark to this day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i029"></a>
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="400" height="524" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ST. MICHAEL ABD THE CONGER.</div>
</div>

<p>Then the conger disappeared in the sea, but
returned again, this time head first, and licked
the saint's hand, who blessed it. Now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
conger is very fine and large, and abundant in its
season, and the white scars down its sides are the
marks of the saint's spurs, which tell the story of
the climb. There are some who say it was a
bean-stalk which grew in the night for the saint
to climb, and those who believe it, may.</p>

<p>The giant's blood flowed over the cliff, and a
church sprung up, which St. Michael dedicated
to himself, and then went away, for the Mount
was not inhabited in those days.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>This was the beginning of the war between
the saints and giants, which continued for
centuries, and might have lasted until now, only
the saints came out on top.</p>

<p>Saint Michael crops up in various places, and,
for convenience, I may add here what is known
of him. He became the patron saint of the
county after meeting with the arch-enemy at
Helston. There was no time to advise the
newspapers, and get special correspondents on
the spot, but it was reported that the battle was
tough and long. The enemy carried a red-hot
boulder under his arm, and hurled it at the saint;
but he was out of practice, and the ball went wide.
Then the saint got in with his trusty blackthorn,
and basted the enemy so well that he couldn't fly
away fast enough for comfort.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The boulder was picked up when cool,
and is still on view at the Angel Hotel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>Saint Michael, having now done enough for
mere reputation, grew ambitious, and turned
author, and that finished him. He wrote "The
Story of my Life," but the publishers returned
the manuscript with compliments; and when he
found he had to pay double postage on the
unstamped parcels, his great heart broke.</p>

<p>The Bookworm got back in time for dinner.
He had been to all the libraries, and made friends
of all the curators, and was going to have a good
time.</p>

<p>We met the American gentleman in the
smoking-room, and he gave us more opinions.
He said this part of the world was a durned sight
too slow for the twentieth century. It was, say,
two hundred years behind the age. He expected
that an American citizen would come across one
day, and just show the people what to do, and
how to do it. This Cornwall was a big show for
the man who knew how to handle it. He took a
special interest in the matter, because of the Gulf
Stream, and he wasn't sure whether or no this
part of the old country came within the Monroe
doctrine. If it's England where the British flag
waves, then isn't it America where American water
runs? And if the Gulf Stream wasn't America,
what was? He told us frankly that he, John B.
Bellamy, Kansas City, Mo., U.S.A., had ideas.</p>

Dolly Pentreath</span>, the fishwife
of Mousehole, had a reputation
as wide, but different, as
Sir Humphry's. Her portrait
is sold in Penzance, wherein
Dolly is only a name now. She
belonged to the adjoining parish of Paul, and so
there is no statue to her in the Market-place,
where she sold fish, and talked the old Cornish
with the real twenty-two carat stamp upon it.
The Bookworm said Dolly's fame had done a
good deal towards advertising the land of a lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
language. He showed us the portrait of a
determined-looking, passionate old party in short
skirts, and a creel on her back. We had seen
already several ancient dames carrying fish quite
as capable of taking care of themselves, which
indicated that if the language is lost, the race
survives. It's a nice walk along the shore to
Mousehole. We might have lingered at Newlyn,
only the Bookworm wanted to get upon classic
ground, where old Dolly used to smoke her pipe,
and drink her flagon of beer with the best, and
talk Cornish&mdash;the real old lingo, hot, sweet, and
strong, so that those who heard her once never forgot
it. Dolly lived to one hundred and two, and
then departed, carrying with her, in her queer old
brain, the completest vocabulary of the Cornish
language upon earth. This is the legend, to
which is to be added that she had the reputation
of being a "witch." There exists an ancient
corner in the village where Dolly would be at
home again if she could come back; and the
Bookworm walked up and down, and in and out,
touching the stones and rubbing shoulders against
the pillars, as though he expected to feel an
electric shock, or receive the straight tip from
the old lady that he'd touched the spot, like
Homocea. He may have passed over it, but
he was happy. If he could only have found an
old clay pipe that Dolly had smoked!</p>

<p>An old man sitting on a post watched us out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of a corner of his eye. He knew what we were
up to, and that there was a trifle at the end of it.
Guy tackled him.</p>

<p>"Dolly Pentreath? Oh yes; she died poor,
and was buried in the parish churchyard of Paul.
People came in shoals to see her monument and
read the inscription."</p>

<p>"Had anybody got anything belonging to her?"</p>

<p>Not that he knew by. "She might have had
a Bible or a hymn-book, but she wasn't given
that way much. So many people wanted 'relics,'
and if there ever were any, they would have been
sold long ago."</p>

<p>All this was straight enough, and his blue eye
looked as clear as the well of truth. We stood
around him as an oracle, and he began his story.</p>

<p>"Dolly Pentreath was a fine woman, with a
voice that you could hear to Newlyn. She had
the heart of a lion, and it was told of her that
when a press-gang landed in search of men for
the navy, Dolly took up a hatchet and fought
them back to their boats, and so cursed them in
old Cornish that that crew never ventured to
come again.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> And she was artful as well as
brave, and saved a man, 'wanted' by the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
for the purpose of hanging, by hiding him in
her chimney. Dolly lived in an old house overlooking
the quay, the walls of which were thick,
and in the chimney was a cavity in which a man
could stand upright, and it was a convenient
hiding-place for many things. 'Back along'
Mousehole was one family, and the ties of blood
spoke eloquently; so, when a man rushed into
Dolly's cottage, saying the officers were after
him, and would hang him to the yardarm of the
ship out in the bay, from which he had taken
French leave the week before, he did not appeal
in vain.</p>

<p>"There was no time to lose, and Dolly rose
to the occasion. Up the chimney she popped the
man; then, taking an armful of dried furze, she
made a fire in the wide open grate, and filled
the crock with water. Into the middle of the
kitchen she pulled a 'keeve,' which she used for
washing, and when the naval officer and his men
burst into the kitchen, Dolly was sitting on a
stool, with her legs bare, and her feet dangling
over the 'keeve.' This was the situation.</p>

<div class="caption">DOLLY PENTREATH.</div>
</div>

<p>"'A man, indeed!' quoth Dolly; 'and me
washing my feet!' She was only waiting for the
water to 'het,' and they might all wash their own,
if they liked. Search? Of 'coose' they might,
and be sugared. (This was old Cornish, of
course.) Would they like to look into the crock,
and see if a man was boiling there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Search they did, and found no man; but
Dolly found her tongue, and let them have it;
and then she found her thick shoes and let them
fly; and then she made for the chopper, and that
cleared the house. Dolly made the most noise
when she heard the poor man cough in his
hiding-place. The aromatic smoke from the
burning furze tickled his throat, and though life
depended on silence, he could not keep it. Then
Dolly gave tongue, and old Cornish&mdash;the genuine
article&mdash;rattled amongst the rafters, like notes
from brazen trumpets blown by tempests. She
threw wide her door, and, with bare legs and
feet, proclaimed to all the world the mission of
the young lieutenant and his men, who now
saw anger in all eyes, and made good their
retreat whilst in whole skins. Then Dolly
liberated the man in the chimney. In the dark
night a fishing lugger stole out of Mousehole
with the deserter on board, and made for
Guernsey, which, in those days, was a sort of
dumping-ground for all who were unable to pay
their debts at home, or were 'wanted' for the
hangman."</p>

<p>The old man, with true blue eyes, turned a
quid in his mouth, and said, with the simplicity
of a child, "And that man was my mother's
father."</p>

<p>Guy was preparing to cross-examine the man
of truth, but we would not have it. It was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
own witness. He had found him sitting on an
iron stump, and was bound to treat him as a
witness of truth. Why shouldn't his own
mother's father have been a deserter from the
king's ship, and been saved by Dolly Pentreath?
Guy agreed; but, said he, it was suspicious that
that man should have been sitting on that very
stump, at the very right moment, and have the
right story on the tip of his tongue for the
right people to listen to. There was too much
"coincidence." We let it go at that.</p>

<p>The Bookworm had the old man with the
truthful blue eyes all to himself for a time,
and discovered the very room in the Keigwin
Arms in which Dolly was wont to take her pint
and her pipe at her ease, and the window out of
which she would thrust her hard old face and
shout to the fishers when they came to the
landing-place. The old lady was keen on her
bargains, and when she had bought her "cate,"
she trudged into Penzance with "creel" on back,
and spoiled the Egyptians, according to the rules
of art. The costume of the fishwife is the same
now as then&mdash;the short skirt, the turned-up
sleeves, the pad for resting the creel. Newhaven
fishwives, but with less colour.</p>

<p>The Bookworm tried some old Cornish, which
he had picked up the previous day, upon the old
man with the truthful blue eyes, but he shook
his head mournfully. "<i>Karenza whelas karenza</i>,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
repeated the Bookworm; but the old man looked
blank, and did not blush at not knowing the
family language. The finest chords of his heart
were untouched; but he brightened up when the
Bookworm sought his hand furtively, and left
something there. Guy said he was perpetuating
testimony.</p>

<p>The old fellow offered to go with us to Paul,
and show us Dolly's monument, but Guy said
the place was consecrated ground, and something
tragic might happen if he refreshed his memory
too largely on the spot. The truthful-looking
eyes were unabashed.</p>

<p>"I don't care," said the Bookworm, as we
walked along the road&mdash;"I don't care; we have
received from the old fellow the impressions
which he received from those who saw Dolly
Pentreath in life&mdash;her passionate self-will and
pluck, her artfulness, her readiness of tongue,
and quickness in making a situation. What
could be more dramatic in a cottage with only
a fireplace, a wash-tray, and a stool in it for
accessories? I don't care how much is invention&mdash;the
living impression is that Dolly would have
done this under the circumstances, and so the
true woman has been presented to us."</p>

<p>"I wish you joy of her, only I'm glad she
doesn't cook my dinner," said Guy. "Let us
reckon up her virtues&mdash;she snuffed, she smoked,
she took her pint, and she cussed upon small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
provocation; these are the four cardinal virtues
in your heroine. I wonder how often she was
before her betters for assault and battery, and
using profane language in an unknown tongue?"</p>

<p>We saluted the monolith in the churchyard
in memory of Dolly Pentreath, but no one can
say for certain that it covers the ashes of that
ancient volcano in petticoats. Guy said he could
not thrill unless he was sure the old lady was
there, and the Bookworm ought to do all the
thrilling for the party.</p>

<p>We were glad to have seen the monument,
and the Bookworm said it was a sign of the
<i>bonne entente</i> which is to be. "The Republic of
Letters is superior to public prejudices and racial
antipathies," he added, with a magnificent wave of
the hand.</p>

<p>We saluted, the monument, including the
shades of Dolly and Prince Lucian, if they
happened to be around, and departed with the
conviction that we had behaved very nicely
towards the lost language and the "Republic
of Letters."</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">
The</span> American citizen was not very
interested in our doings. He
thought that one language was
good enough for the whole earth,
and that was English, improved
by the United States. There were
languages still spoken in America which, he guessed,
wouldn't be missed if they died out, as well as
the people who spoke them. He wasn't gone on
lost languages, or lost trades, or lost anything,
but was a living man, and wanted people about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
him to show life. He had been told to take
back some "relics" of the late King Arthur,
because there was money in them, and he was
going to Tintagel to look round&mdash;a button, or
shoe-lace, or lock of hair picked up on the spot
would fetch something considerable. There was
a market for "relics" on the other side. We
told him we weren't keen on "relics" for commercial
purposes, and were going the other way
first, so he would have it all his own way as far
as we were concerned.</p>

<p>We reached the Land's End at the lowest of
low water, and touched the very last bit of
rock visible, so as to be able to say we'd touched
the very last stone of dry England. We left it
there for future generations to touch.</p>

<p>Cornwall is a tract of land with one-third in
pickle, and what can't be walked over can be
sailed over. When you sail far enough you reach
the Scilly Isles, which is a sort of knuckle-end to
the peninsula which once was land. There isn't
very much to be found out in books about the
land under the sea. Of course it is there, or
water wouldn't be on top.</p>

<p>The Cornwall under the sea is the land of
romance, where, some say, King Arthur was
born. There is no getting away from this land
under the sea, for the old fairies rise from it still,
and spread enchantment. We were told that
every little boy and girl born in the peninsula is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
breathed over by the fairies, and in after-life,
wherever they may be, they turn their faces in
sleep towards the west, and dream. From under
the sea there rises, morn and eve, the sound of
bells, telling their own tale with infinite charm.
The stranger who comes into the county must
hear these sounds and thrill, and see in sunshine
and shadow, on hill and in coombe, on moor and
fen, the fluttering of impalpable wings; for if he
hears and sees them not, he will depart the
stranger he came, though he live a lifetime in
the land. In Cornwall everything is alive&mdash;the
mine, the moor, the sea, the deep pools, the
brooks, the groves, the sands, the caves; everything
has its moan and harmony and inspiration.
And the land under the sea, which is called
Lyonesse by the poets, was a fairy zone, and some
say it sank in the night, and some say other
things harder to believe.</p>

<p>Cornwall under the sea has been there a long
time. Some people, who like to be accurate
above all things, say it disappeared in the year
1089, and contained 140 parish churches, and
God wot how many chapels, and baptistries, and
holy wells, and places. The only survivor was
a Trevelyan, of Basil, near Launceston, who was
on the back of a swimming horse. As it is not
improbable that the inhabitants of Lyonesse
traded with somebody elsewhere and owed them
money, it is wonderful that the bad debts should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
have been wiped out without a murmur, and that
no entry has been found in any court, or in the
accounts and deeds of abbeys and priories of any
interest in the 140 parish churches, and chapels,
and holy wells, and baptistries. The Trevelyans
seem to have been a larkish family, for when one
of them was arrested for debt, he fetched a beehive
and presented it to the bailiffs, who ran
away from honey and honeycomb as fast as they
could. The chimes which rise from the 140 parish
churches under the sea are very beautiful to those
who hear them. The square-set man who tacked
himself on to us smiled when we asked him to
say honestly if he had heard them. He had
heard people say that they had. Some people
are wonderfully quick at hearing.</p>

<p>The fact remains that from Land's End to
Scilly is blue water, and from Scilly to Sandy
Hook is blue water also. There are some other
facts of almost equal interest, if one cares about
them; but the first and foremost fact is, that
every one standing for the first time upon the
bluff, perpendicular cliffs at the Land's End, turns
his face seawards, and says, "There's nothing
between me and America." Many people also
think that the waves breaking on the dark rocks
travel all the way from Sandy Hook without
stopping for the privilege of dying on English
soil. Wherever they come from they're welcome,
and so also are the winds laden with Atlantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
brine, which certainly have touched no land since
they left the other side. No American tourist
ever comes as far west as Penzance without
rushing to the Land's End to get a lung-full of
home air, as pure and unadulterated as it can be
got in this old country.</p>

<p>Guy was particularly interested in the Gulf
Stream, which we found was another matter of
unfailing interest to everybody, and at all times
and seasons. Some things may be explained
every hour of the day without being explained
away, like the sun's light, or a rainbow, or a new
baby's eyes. Guy wanted to have the Gulf
Stream pointed out to him, just as though it were
painted red on the chart, or sent up clouds of
steam. There wasn't much fun in looking for the
Gulf Stream, only, being on the spot, one was
obliged to do it. We had heard such a lot about
it at the hotel, and the square-set man told us
that people always made a dash for the Gulf
Stream when they came here. His story of the
old lady bringing eggs with her to cook in the
Stream kept us in good temper when we found
for ourselves that the water was just the same as
any other sea-water, as far as we could tell, and
that we should not have suspected the Gulf
Stream of being near if we hadn't been told.
Guy said it was a fine thing to know it was
somewhere about, even if we couldn't see it, because
it was a sort of link between the old world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and the new, and made it easy to understand why
Mr. Choate was made a Bencher. Guy promised
to think the matter out, and put it in another
way if we couldn't quite understand the reference.</p>

<p>The square-set man said he was sure there
was a Gulf Stream, because foreign seaweed was
picked up sometimes; and if it wasn't for the
Stream, early potatoes and broccoli wouldn't be
early, and the flowers at Scilly would be just the
same as at other places. It's a long way for a
stream to come, and the square-set man told us
that at one time it must have been stronger than
now, for it carried away the mainland between us
and Scilly; but when Guy cross-examined him
on what he called a question of fact, he broke
down, and finished off by saying that that was
what "people said." Guy was willing that there
should be a Gulf Stream, but he bristled when
told that the peninsula was snapped off like a
carrot, and carried away by a stream from the
Gulf of Mexico. His English pride was hurt,
and he declared that he'd rather do without early
potatoes and broccoli and flowers from Scilly for
the rest of his life than that foreign water should
ever be said to have carried away English acres,
and so many of them. The invasion of England
by the Gulf Stream indeed! Then where were
the Navy League, and the Coast Defence Committee,
and Mr. Balfour's great speech in the
House of Commons?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>There was one spot that we must see and
stand upon, and the square-set man was sure of
himself this time. We must go and stand upon
the rock where Wesley stood before composing
the hymn, "Lo, on a narrow neck of land."
People come from all quarters of the universe for
this privilege, and some people actually go away
and compose hymns and send copies to the
square-set man. He did not say what he did
with them, but he did not talk respectfully of an
absent lady who mailed him a poem from New
York and forgot the postage stamps.</p>

<p>It was Guy's idea to stay where we were.
He put it very nicely to the Bookworm about
"communing with Nature, the great unwritten
book, and all that sort of thing, you know." Guy
was afraid that he would make a bee-line for the
library if we returned to Penzance, and that we
should have to dig him out again. "We'll keep
him in the open, and let the square-set man stuff
him with pre-historic monuments&mdash;something
solid, you know, after the Gulf Stream." Guy's
mind was constantly running on the Gulf Stream.
He didn't care a fig for the stream, he said, in
the course of the evening, and it was welcome to
travel where it would; but when it came to
taking away English soil, he wouldn't hear it;
no, not if all the scientists in the universe were
against him.</p>

<p>Most people carry away something&mdash;pebbles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
or blooms, or bits of seaweed, or something of
that sort&mdash;and there's plenty left; and all seem
to carry away "impressions." The guide-books
don't help the impressionists much, for everything
appears different to every other person, as though
the local fairies had a hand in it.</p>

<p>The square-set man called upon us in the
evening, and told us stories of people whom he
had conducted around the cliffs, and from monument
to monument. The cliffs, we found, were
"grand," "sublime," or "terrible;" and the rest
was summed up in "charming," "queer," "fantastic,"
"unaccountable," "odd," "sweet," and
the like. Specialists, of course, had their own pet
phrases; but our friend was particularly struck
with the fancy of the gentleman who saw in the
cliffs only admirable situations for solving the
great mystery. The higher the point, the more
he seemed delighted. "Now, this is what I call
a grand place for committing suicide," he finished
off by saying, and "tipped" so liberally that Mr.
Square-set is on the look-out for his return. An
emotion once so deeply stirred will surely need
be stirred again, he hinted.</p>

<p>When we asked Square-set to sit down and
chat a bit, he said he'd be very pleased to
"tich-pipe;" and when I passed him my pouch,
he said he hadn't smoked since he was a young
man.</p>

<p>"What you want to touch-a-pipe for if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
don't smoke, I can't imagine," said Guy; and
then we found that "tich-pipe" had nothing to
do with the weed, but simply meant an interval
of rest.</p>

<p>The Bookworm made a note.</p>

No</span> one ever comes here without inquiring
for "wreckers"&mdash;Cornish
wreckers are in demand. Guy
put artful questions artfully, but
could get no admissions beyond
that&mdash;that he had "heard tell"
that in ancient days things were done which no
honest, God-fearing man should do. He was
always being asked about wreckers and their
doings, and a real, live sample on show would be
a fortune to any man. What was called "wrecking"
now was simply picking up and carrying
away little odds and ends which the sea threw up
high and dry upon the beaches. And why not?
Who had a better title to them?</p>

</div>

<p>Guy said he supposed it was all right; and he
remembered there was authority for saying that
the king is rex because all wrecks belong to him.
If so, then wreckers are rexers in their own right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and can do no wrong. Mr. Square-set was not
impressed, but he assured us that the double-dyed
villain of Cornish romances innumerable
was extinct now, and Mr. Carnegie's millions
could not purchase a specimen for the British
Museum. It was a disappointment not to find a
"wrecker"&mdash;the bold, bad man who tied lanterns
to cows' tails, and sent up false lights to lure
passing ships to destruction. We wanted to
shake hands with one and stand him drinks, and
make notes of his bushy eyebrows and the colour
of his eyes, and then turn him inside out to discover
what his secret thoughts were when hatching
diabolical plans. Our faith in Cornish romances
received a great shock just then, and
Guy's cherished ambition to write "The Chronicles
of Joseph Penruddock, Wrecker," suffered
frost-bite. The world will never know more.</p>

<p>Of deeds of derring-do for the saving of life
our square-set friend was full. This was another
picture&mdash;a picture of black night and tempest,
and noble souls wrestling with death and destruction,
with scarce one faint chance in their favour.
He told us of a man who hung over the precipitous
cliff which we had stood on that morning,
shuddering as we looked down in the full light of
day, and the sea calm as the surface of a mirror;
he told us of a man who descended that cliff by a
rope when a storm was raging, and the sea "boiling"
beneath him, and how he brought back in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
his arms a burden, battered, but still living, and
how, in mid-air, the strands of the rope were
chafed, so that those above trembled as they
hauled. And as he spoke an inward glow spread
over the man's face and revealed him. Guy
seized the man's hands in both his own and wrung
them, saying, "Great Scott! and you are the man
who did this thing!" He told us afterwards that
he couldn't help himself, and wasn't the least
ashamed of being a bit "soft" just then. To
think that this hero was the man we picked up
scratching himself against a cromlech and looking
for a job!</p>

<p>We couldn't get away from the sea now, and
Mr. Square-set told us how differently sailors in
misfortune were treated now than formerly&mdash;how
they were fed and clothed and sent from one end
of the country to the other, wherever they wished
to go&mdash;in fact, by rail. In his young days it was
not so, and a shipwrecked mariner was compelled
to tramp wherever he chose to go, either to his
own home or to the next port, in the hope of getting
a berth. But a tramp in fine weather, sleeping
in the fields and outhouses at night, and begging
at decent houses by day, was very much
enjoyed by the men, who became heroes when
they returned home. He told us the story of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Two Ancient Mariners</span></p>

<p>who hailed from Cornwall, and once found themselves
stranded in the port of London, with little
but what they stood upright in. They were
young men and merry-hearted, and stood by each
other in fair weather or foul, as shipmates should.
They hailed from the same fishing village, and
wished to be home during the "feast" week, which
was near at hand. Failing to find a coasting
vessel bound west, they started to walk, and part
of their arrangement was to take it in turns to call
at gentlemen's houses and ask for assistance.
They preferred not to go to the same house together,
but to leave one on the look-out, in case
of "squalls." They got on well enough for some
days, sleeping where they could, and telling yarns
of peril and disaster, most likely, in their opinion,
to melt the hearts of hearers. And the story
went like this&mdash;</p>

<p>"They came to a great gentleman's house, and
it was Tommy Hingston's turn to go in, and Bill
Baron's to watch outside. Tommy went up, as
bold as brass, and asked for the gentleman, who
was at home, and received him very kindly; and
when he found he had come from London, he
asked him for the latest news.</p>

<p>"'There's fine news, sure 'nuff,' says Tom.</p>

<p>"'Then let me have it, my man.'</p>

<p>"'Haven't 'ee heard it, yer honour? Haven't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
'ee heard that London was as black as night at
noon-day?'</p>

<p>"'Most remarkable,' said the gentleman; 'and
can you tell me what caused the darkness?'</p>

<p>"'Sartin sure I can. A monstrous great bird
flew over the town, and shut out the sun with his
wings.'</p>

<p>"'That is astonishing. And did you hear
anything else?'</p>

<p>"'Ess; they've a-turned Smithfield Market
into a kitchen, and all the people are to be fed
upon whitepot.'</p>

<p>"'You really mean it?'</p>

<p>"'I tasted it, yer honour,' replied Tom.</p>

<p>"'And was there anything else worthy of
notice?'</p>

<p>"Tom scratched his head. 'There was
something else,' he added, in a sort of hardly-worth-talking-about
style. 'The River Thames
catched on fire.'</p>

<p>"'Ah,' said the gentleman, rising and ringing
the bell; 'and I have "catched" a rank imposter,
and, being a magistrate, will commit you
forthwith to prison as a rogue and a vagabond.'</p>

<p>"Billy Baron was keeping watch outside, and
as his mate did not return, he grew uneasy. By-and-by
he marched up and 'faced the brass
knocker,' and was brought before the gentleman,
who was now writing out a committal order, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Tom he saw standing, bolt upright, by the side
of a man who had charge of him.</p>

<p>"Billy was a soft-hearted man, and burst into
tears. Then the gentleman told Billy, in very
straight terms, what he thought of his mate&mdash;a
lying imposter, whom he was sending to
prison.</p>

<p>"'Never!' said Billy, firmly. 'I'll lay my
life on him.'</p>

<p>"'Very well; then, tell me, did you see a
great bird fly over London, so large as to hide
the light of the sun with its wings?'</p>

<p>"'No, sir,' replied Billy. 'I didn't see the
bird, but I seed four horses dragging an egg,
which people said a great bird had laid.'</p>

<p>"'You <i>are</i> a truthful man,' said the gentleman.</p>

<p>"'I hope so,' said Billy, with one eye on
his mate.</p>

<p>"'I hope so, too. Then, tell me, did you eat
some whitepot at Smithfield Market?'</p>

<p>"'No, I didn't, yer honour, but I seed a store
full of gurt horn spoons.'</p>

<p>"'He told me something else, and I'm sure
you'll answer truthfully. He told me he saw the
River Thames on fire.'</p>

<p>"'However cud 'ee have said that, Tom?'
blurted out Billy, reproachfully. 'He never seed
the river on fire, but what we did see was waggon
and waggon-loads of fish carted away with burnt
fins and tails.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"'And they would have been taken from the
burning river?'</p>

<p>"'I do not doubt it; but, mind, I dedn't zee
it,' said Billy, with the air of a martyr to the
truth.</p>

<p>"The gentleman, no longer able to contain
himself, sent Tom and Billy down to the kitchen,
and gave them the best 'blaw out' they had on
the journey. And, when they left, he told them,
by way of compliment, that they were 'real
Cornish diamonds, and the best pair of liars' he
had ever known.</p>

<p>"And they were hard to beat," said Mr.
Square-set.</p>

Our</span> square-set friend owned up to
smuggling as one of the virtues
of his countrymen. The real
thing is getting scarce now.
One evening he brought an old
acquaintance with him, introducing
him crisply as "Uncle Bill." We saw a
good deal of Uncle Bill afterwards, who was
ninety next birthday, and ready and willing to
"fight, wrassel, or run" with any man of his age
in this country or the next. We did not doubt
him, for his blue eye was clear, he moved easily,
and his pink finger-tips and filbert-shaped nails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
showed breed. Uncle Bill looked as though he
intended to carry out his bat for a century or
more. He was, he said, as sound as a bell,
except that he was a bit "tiched on the wind"
when walking against a hill. Never took
"doctor's traade," as he contemptuously called
physic, and his cure for all ills was a pipe of
'bacca to smoke and a pen'ard of gin mixed with
a pen'ard of porter. He said he had done a
little smuggling, in the old-fashioned way, in a
small lugger, running for dear life across the
Channel in a gale of wind when the King's
cutters were all snug in harbour, and then landing
the tubs of spirits and parcels of lace and
other things under the very noses of the preventive
men. "They dedn't prevent we," said
Uncle Bill, his face all a-glow with the pleasures
of memory. He told us that he settled down to
fishing when his "calling," and that of his father
before him, was interfered with; but the dash
and peril and the fame of successful smuggling
suited him, and warmed up the cockles of his
heart now only to think about. He spoke of
himself as an injured man because he received
no compensation for disturbance.</p>

<p>Guy worked at the subject, and came to the
conclusion that Cornwall was as intended by
Nature for smuggling as the inhabitants were
for carrying it on. Every little bay and creek
and cavern, villages and farmhouses, even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
tombs in the parish churches, could tell tales.
And the women, they were hand in glove with
their husbands and sweethearts, fathers and
brothers; and all that made life worth living
then was made dependent on a successful "run"
from a little French port with goods honestly
bought and paid for, but&mdash;the sorrow and shame
of it!&mdash;made contraband the moment they
touched English soil.</p>

<p>"Bad laws made smugglers," said the Bookworm,
provokingly, to Guy, who always fires up
with professional wrath when he hears of anything
bad in connection with the law.</p>

<p>"Bad fiddlesticks! People smuggled because
they liked it&mdash;just as you liked it when you
smuggled those nice little Tauchnitz editions last
year, and without thinking of the poor devil of
an author in England that you were robbing,"
replied Guy.</p>

<p>"That never occurred to me," said the Bookworm,
meekly.</p>

<p>"Of course not. You are only a petty
smuggler, but a smuggler all the same. And do
you mean to tell me that 'bad laws,' forsooth,
made you smuggle the books? Not a bit of it.
You liked the game, and you know it."</p>

<p>There is a grandeur about the old smuggler
which increases with age. He put his little all
upon a venture&mdash;nothing of the limited liability
principle about him. The lugger which left a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Cornish fishing cove was, as a rule, family property,
owned by father and sons, or by two or
three brothers. The family capital was put into
one purse, carried away, and converted into
honest brandy, wines, and other articles of commerce.
Then the struggle commenced between
the individual who pitted his own cunning and
frail boat against the King's cruisers and all the
resources of a mighty State. He was surrounded
by "spies" from the moment his cargo was on
board until he was ready to slip from his moorings.
He could trust no man. And then his
voyage across the Channel was a race for life&mdash;in
fog, in tempest, when only a madman would
run the risk, the old smuggler would "up sail
and off;" and if a King's officer liked to follow,
then all he'd see would be the drippings from the
smuggler's keel. The god of storms was the
smuggler's divinity, and he loved his little craft,
which was, for the time, a thing of life fleeing
from pursuit, from imprisonment, and even death
when cannon-balls flew about. How the old
smuggler prayed for storm and night, for any
peril which would enable him to show courage
and mastery over the elemental forces which
should drive his pursuers to destruction!</p>

<p>And how he would fight when brought to
bay! When becalmed, the King's cutter would
send a boat alongside to board the lugger, every
man armed with pistol and cutlass, and wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the uniform of authority. Then the smuggler
would fight for property and life, cast off the
grappling-irons, and cut down the man who
ventured to set foot upon his little craft. And
all the while the old man at the helm looked
fixedly at the heavens and across the water to
see if, perchance, a "breath of wind" was stirring&mdash;only
a breath might be his salvation when he
was too far inshore for the King's cutter to
venture, and his men fighting off the cutters
crew like heroes. Then a puff, and the sail
draws; then more wind, and, inch by inch, the
lugger sails away from cutter and cutter's crew,
only, perhaps, to fall in with another enemy
which has to be out-sailed, or out-man&oelig;uvred, or
fought off, as best serves the purpose. No surrender
when boat and cargo is the bread of the
family.</p>

<p>Then the old smuggler reaches home, and
every shadow may spell ruin; and all that is
done is done in fear, and he has to be cunning
always, and ready to fight to the death. The
old smuggler belonged to the heroic age, and in
all genuine stories he bulks colossal against a
midnight sky black with tempest. The race has
not disappeared; the conditions have changed,
that is all. Uncle Bill told us that he could find
a crew to-morrow if there was but a fair prospect
of making five hundred pounds on the venture.
And "I'd be one," said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>If Nature intended a county for smuggling,
it is Cornwall, which seems somehow to have
been caught when cooling between two seas and
pressed inward and upward, so that it is full of
little bights and bays and caverns, which might
have been vents for the gases to escape when the
sea pressure at the sides became unbearable, and
the earth groaned like the belle of the season in
tight corsets. The caverns are given up to bats
and otters and slimy things now, but in the
"good old days!" The women, by all accounts,
took kindly to smuggling, and stood shoulder to
shoulder with their men when there was a fight
with the preventive men, and ran off with the
"tubs" of spirit and whatever they could carry,
whilst the men held the King's officers in check.
A young man who was content with a "living
wage" on sea or on land wasn't thought much of
by the black-haired, black-eyed damsels of the
coast, who were up to snuff in the free-trade
principles of their day and generation. The
children were taught to look upon the sea as
their own, and to regard smuggling as an honourable
calling, and thousands of infant tongues
prayed at night for God's blessing on smuggling
ventures. And the Church was with the people,
and blessed them, and shared their profits
when there was no danger of being found out.
"Nothing venture, nothing have" was the good
old motto bound upon the smugglers' arms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
hearts like phylacteries, and was to them as
prayer.</p>

<div class="caption">A SHORT CUT.</div>
</div>

<p>Uncle Bill had a pen'ard of gin in his beer
to clear his pipes one evening, and told us some
yarns which he had heard from his father, who
was called Enoch, who died in his bed at the age
of ninety-six, and would have lived longer, only
he "catched a cauld dru washing his feet in fresh
water."</p>

<p>Uncle Bill was a young man, but not too
young to go courting when his father made his
last run across the Channel for a cargo of spirits.
It came about in this way. Enoch and his family
possessed five hundred one-pound notes issued
by a bank which had failed, and so were practically
worthless. This was a serious matter,
and Enoch proposed, at the family council, to run
across to Brittany and exchange the worthless
notes for tubs of good brandy. Everything was
done in secrecy and in hot haste to prevent
suspicion, and to get the cargo of contraband on
board before news of the bank's failure reached
the French merchants. Had they been members
of the Japanese Intelligence Department they
could not have kept the secret better. They had
a splendid run, landed the cargo all serene, and
cleared cent. per cent.</p>

<p>"I have often blessed God that there were
no telegraphs in those days," said Uncle Bill,
fervently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"What became of the notes?" asked Guy.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Uncle Bill, with a
lively wink. "All I know is we had the brandy."</p>

<p>"Is this genuine, or only make-up?" asked
Guy.</p>

<p>"As true as the Gospel," replied Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>He told us many other stories, but we thought
this best worth preserving, as it showed native
cunning, promptness, and audacity.</p>

<p>"And I have lived to hear a man bless God
that there were no such things as electric telegraphs,"
said the Bookworm, realizing that he
was now in an England of a century ago.</p>

<p>Uncle Bill was a good old sort, and once
when he came to see us he pulled a medicine-bottle
from the folds of his knitted frock, and,
taking out the cork, invited us to taste. It was
pure cognac, and its flavour was what the old
man called "rich." The spirit had not been
coloured, and had a history, which the old man
told with relish. News was one day brought
to the coastguard station by a boatman that a
cask was stranded on an adjacent beach, and the
coastguard officer, who loved his joke and good
company, summoned numerous good men and
true (Uncle Bill being one) to go to the beach,
and there hold an inquest upon the said cask and
its contents.</p>

<p>"My men," said the coastguard officer, "I
summon you in the name of the Queen (God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
bless her) to come with me to Treganna beach,
and to taste the contents of a cask which we
shall find there. I think it's a brandy cask," he
added, "and you are to act as Queen's tasters.
Now, my men, if you declare that the contents
of the cask are wines or spirits, then the same
will be seized on behalf of the Crown, and the
Excise will claim it; and if you further declare
that the contents taste of salt water, then the
cask will be staved in, and the contents run out
upon the beach. You are the jurors, and meet
me here in half an hour. If any of 'ee have a
tin can it might be handy" said he, with a wink.</p>

<p>When the jurors met again, they all had something
in their hands in the shape of tin cans or
pitchers; and there were men upon this jury who
had not tasted spirits at their own expense for
many years, and they carried the largest pitchers.</p>

<p>The coastguard officer produced a gimlet, and
broached the cask, and every man tasted.</p>

<p>"The smell of it was enough for me," said
Uncle Bill; "but I tasted, like the rest. It
went down 'ansum, sure nuff. And some of us
tasted again, to make sure for sartin."</p>

<p>Says the coastguard officer, "What is it, my
men?"</p>

<p>"Cognac."</p>

<p>"So say you all?"</p>

<p>"One and all, for sure."</p>

<p>"Then I seize the cask, in the Queen's name."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>He took out a bit of chalk, and marked the
broad arrow upon it; but our jugs were empty.
The best of the game was to come.</p>

<p>"Now, my men, tell me, as good men and
true, whether the brandy has been touched with
salt water."</p>

<p>So we all tasted again, and said it was sickly,
and brackish, and made such faces that you might
think we were poisoned.</p>

<p>"And so say you all?"</p>

<p>"Ess, one and all."</p>

<p>"And your verdict is that the cask of brandy,
seized in the Queen's name, is brackish?"</p>

<p>"That is our verdict."</p>

<p>"Then I order the cask to be stove in and
its contents run upon the beach."</p>

<p>And when the head was stove in, he turned
his back upon us, and every can and jug and
pitcher was filled, and, if we'd only known, we'd
have had more pails and buckets and pitchers.</p>

<p>"I've got a drop still left, and 'tis precious,"
said Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>This medicine-bottle was his gift to us, and
we now knew the flavour of cognac cast upon
the shore, which had never paid the Queen's
penny.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder that smuggling was popular,"
said Guy.</p>

<p>Smuggling made the sort of sailor that Nelson
loved, a man who could fight and forgive when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
worsted, like the old smuggler of Talland, who
had it recorded on his tombstone that he prayed
God to pardon those wicked preventive men
who shed his innocent blood.</p>

<p>It was in the Lizard district that smuggling
reached its zenith. The Bookworm put a copy
of the "Autobiography of a Smuggler" into his
pocket when he tramped over to Prussia Cove,
a place which Nature and a little art intended
for an emporium for smugglers. Blind harbours,
blind caves, hidden galleries, mysterious inlets
and exits form a delicate network of safety and
concealment. Only a century ago, the man who
lived here was the king of Cornish smugglers
and privateers, and defended himself with his
own cannon.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Now the fine caves are fern-arched,
and the water drips, drips, drips upon
nothing precious. The smugglers borrowed
these caves from the piskies who have re-entered
into possession, for here are the piskie sands and
piskie caves.</p>

<p>"Here, in cool grot, the piskies dwell,"
hummed Guy.</p>

<p>The caves seemed none the worse for having
been smugglers' storehouses; but the gingerbeer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and sandwich man left his trail, as usual. What
he couldn't reach or cut down, he left alone, but
broken glass he left behind.</p>

<p>Guy ran across a gentleman anxious to tell
us things. He was a "pensioner." The man
with a pension is a common object by the seashore.
After a time, you get to know him as a
superior sort of being reduced from his high
estate, and only making the two ends meet by
the grace of God. "Get a pension, and don't
worry" is very good advice when the pension
is big enough; but generally the pension-man is
a trifle seedy&mdash;his pension won't spread all over
him, but leaves him minus gloves, with patched
shoes, and short everywhere. This honest old
gentleman was Guy's find, and he was so eager
to tell all he knew, and more on top of it, that
Guy was glad, at last, to get rid of him with
some excuse covered deftly with a small consideration.</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">
There</span> is a good deal of history in
Cornwall. Some may be read
in stones, and some in books.
The stone reading is very interesting
to those who like it, and
affords a good scope for imagination.
Without imagination, stone reading is a
trifle dull. Stones are everywhere at the Land's
End and Lizard&mdash;some are stationary, and some
"rock," and all are weather-worn. The Bookworm
had a trick of running his hands over the
surfaces of pre-historic monuments, like a blind
man reading. It was just a fancy of his that
he was shaking hands with antiquity. Our Mr.
Square-set put his pencil mark in our Murray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
against what is called the "show-stones," and
he couldn't tell us much more than we could
find out for ourselves. We thought it best
to let ancient stone history alone until we had
a dull Sunday, or a wet day; and look out for
what was nearer our own times.</p>

<p>We found that the Cornishman's motto is
"One and All," and that "One" comes first, so
he says, "I and the King;" and, when he speaks
geographically, it is Cornwall first, then England,
and then the rest. Formerly, everything outside
of England was Cornwall, but he is not so sure
now. However, he always takes a bit of the old
county with him when he travels, so that the
piskies may find him. A Cornishman abroad is
given to "wishtness," and so he gets up clubs in
London and other places, and talks of pasties
and cream, blue skies and sapphire seas, and
sings "Trelawney," and dances the "Flurry"
dance, and One and All's it generally.</p>

<p>The Cornish had their own kings and queens&mdash;and
as the kings were liberal to themselves in
the matter of queens, they were not always
happy. The Bookworm helped us a good deal
at times, and told us that the ancient kings were
not much given to diplomatic correspondence,
nor to the keeping of "memorials of the reign,"
so that modern historians had a pretty free hand.
The kings, however, must have been numerous
at one time, as there was a king at Gweek and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
another at Marazion&mdash;as thick as tenants on a
gentleman's estate. Cornish history had, however,
been worked up by poets, and the characters of the
old kings drawn by Tennyson and Kingsley were
not too amiable. There was Tennyson's Cornish
king, who had an uncomfortable way of sneaking
round on tiptoe and striking a man in the back.
The poet had not made allowance for the fact
that King Modred lived in days before private
inquiry offices were invented, and so was obliged
to do his own dirty work, instead of employing
a professional spy at per hour and expenses.
For real knowledge of Cornish kings, Kingsley
whips creation. Listen!</p>

<p>"Fat was the feasting, and loud was the
harping, in the halls of Alef, King of Gweek."
There was going to be a wedding, so that may
pass. Then we come to details worthy of the poet
historian: "Savory was the smell of fried pilchard
and hake; more savory still that of roast porpoise;
most savory of all that of fifty huge
squab pies, built up of layers of apples, bacon,
onions, and mutton, and at the bottom of each a
squab, or young cormorant, which diffused both
through the pie and through the ambient air, a
delicate odour of mingled guano and polecat."
There was a little toddy, of course, to wash it
down, and a few songs with harp accompaniment,
and the bride, being properly elated with the
perfume of "guano and polecat," was very civil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and, being a princess in her own right, and queen
of Marazion, gave the vocalist a ring to remember
her by. The next morning the newly-wedded
pair start off on their honeymoon, and
this is what happens. The King of Marazion
grips his bride's arm until she screams, and
says, "And you shall pass your bridal night in
my dog-kennel, after my dog-whip has taught
you not to give rings again to wandering
harpers."</p>

<p>Tennyson and Kingsley have been read pretty
generally by men and women of the Anglo-Saxon
race, and some people may even think that the
Cornish kings were like these portraits, and fed
upon "guano and polecat" flavoured pies, and
whipped their brides to sleep in dog-kennels in
their bridal garments. Poets have always been
privileged.</p>

<p>There were Cornish "kings," of course, just
as there were Cornish "saints" and a Cornish
language, and all three played their little
parts, and went off the stage, without even the
lights being turned down for them. With regard
to the kings, this seemed to have happened:
when the local rates and taxes were getting too
high, and trouble was brewing about the Education
Act, the kings saw that they must go under,
and gave way to a Duke. Edward the Black
Prince, having won his spurs in the Crusades, the
kings asked him to take over what they could no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
longer keep, or didn't want, and so, "like a
Cornishman's gift, what he does not want for
himself" became a proverb. The proverb may
be relied on as authentic. The Prince of Wales
has been the Duke of Cornwall ever since, so the
Cornish people have had a very close connection
with royalty from pre-historic times, as the Bookworm
discovered; then through Kingsley's "guano
and polecat" period, and then from Edward the
Black Prince down to the present, which we can
verify for ourselves every year, when the Duchy
accounts are published, and the ancient tribute
passes into the noble Duke's banking account.
History loses much of its charm for poets and
romantic souls when it enters the prosaic region
of banker's ledger and cheque book, but this sort
of prose has advantages.</p>

<p>The Cornish had a long way to walk when
they wanted just to talk matters over with their
sovereign. They went in their thousands to
London on several occasions when things were
not to their liking, and the late Queen was the
first sovereign of the realm to come into the
county and "God bless" the people on their own
doorsteps. Charles I. came into the county
under very peculiar circumstances, and, though
he was qualifying for martyrdom, he found time
to write a very handsome letter of thanks "to
the Inhabitants of the county of Cornwall" for
giving the Cromwelliams more than they bargained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
for, or wanted even, on several occasions. This
letter is still to be found painted on boards
in parish churches, and as conspicuously placed
as the Lord's Prayer or the Ten Commandments.
The practice of reading the letter in
churches and chapels has long been discontinued,
but the testimony to unselfish devotion and
gallant defence of a sovereign whose star was
setting in blood remains.</p>

<p>Good Queen Bess rather liked Cornishmen,
or said she did, which answered the same purpose.
She said that "Cornish gentlemen were all born
courtiers, with a becoming confidence," two
qualities which naturally attracted her as woman
and lady. Climate probably has something to
do with native politeness, and that is why the
Eastern races are so civil to one another.</p>

<p>The people are like Japs for politeness to
one another on a deal. When a man is drawing
the long bow and coming it too strong, the other
fellow will say, "I wonder if it is so," with the
slightest possible accent of suspicion in his tone.
We were present when two men were trying to
make a deal in horseflesh, "halter for halter," as
the saying is. The owner of a weedy-looking
chestnut wished to swop with the owner of a useful
black cob, and his rhetoric was florid. Sometimes
he drew on his imagination in praise of the
chestnut, and the owner of the black cob would
say, "I wonder now," just by way of note of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
admiration. Then the chestnut's owner, growing
bolder and more vigorous in his style, garnished
his language with many fancy words, and wound
up by asking, "Doan't 'ee believe me?" And
the other man replied, as politely as a Chesterfield,
"I'll believe 'ee to oblige 'ee." The Foreign
Office couldn't beat it.</p>

<p>The Bookworm discovered that Cornwall had
somehow linked itself with great names in history,
or, rather, that some great names had linked
themselves with Cornwall, using her as a gallant
for a season, and then passing out of her life.
Camelford had three successful wooers in Lord
Lansdowne, Lord Brougham, and "Ossian"
Macpherson; Lostwithiel was wooed and won
by Joseph Addison; then Horace Walpole, jilted
at Callington, made up to East Looe, still attractive,
when the great Lord Palmerston came along
with a buttonhole in his coat and the blarney.
Then John Hampden found a first love in Grampound,
and Sir Francis Drake a soft place in the
bosom of Bossiney, a mere village close to the
angry roar of Tintagel's sea. But all these seats
were mere lights o' love, and some were swept
away on account of their dissoluteness before the
great Reform Bill, and then the rest went, and
none were remembered on account of their gallant
political lovers. Guy said it didn't make a bit of
difference what the constituency was, or where,
so long as the man was right. He saw a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
many advantages in the old pocket borough; and
if he ever went into Parliament (which he might)
as a stepping-stone to the Woolsack (like the
veteran Lord Chancellor, who found comfortable
quarters at Launceston), he'd like to have the
fewest number of constituents, and those all of
one mind. But the Bookworm would not have
it that way, and stuck to his guns that it was the
constituency which really had a seat in Parliament,
and constituency and member were one
and indivisible; and when not, there was failure
somewhere in first principles. The Bookworm
always takes these things so seriously, Guy says.</p>

Most</span> of the saints came into
Cornwall, dropping little bits of
fame and reputation as they
travelled from parish to parish,
and from holy well to holy well.
Old Fuller says they were born
under a travelling planet, "neither bred where
born, nor beneficed where bred, nor buried where
beneficed," but wandering ever. Cornwall is
known as the "Land of Saints," and county
teams are usually "Saints." "The Saints <i>v</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>

<p>The true story of the saints is a little mixed;
the giants and the piskies come in, and wherever
the saints went there was sure to be trouble.
We picked up a few stories, not all in one place,
but here and there. Those already published we
weeded out, together with some which appeared
doubtful. Some needed a little patching up in
places, and the Bookworm said the most imperfect
were the most genuine. The following
were thought worthy of survival.</p>

<div class="caption">KING TEWDRIG AND THE SAINTS.</div>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">King Tewdrig and the Saints.</span></p>

<p>Irish saints swarmed as thick as flies in
summer in the reign of Tewdrig the King, who
built his castle on the sands at Hayle, wherein it
now is, only the X-rays are not strong enough to
make it visible. This Tewdrig was a good old
sort, and was called Theodore by the saints as
long as he had anything to give. But the saints
letting it be known in the distressful land that
they had struck oil, their friends and relatives
swarmed across the Channel in such crowds that
the King was in danger of being eaten out of
house and home. He summoned the Keeper of
the Victuals, and asked for a report. He had it;
and it was short and sad&mdash;as sad in its way as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
an army stores inquiry. Every living thing in
air and field and wood had been devoured. All
the salted meats in the keeves had disappeared,
"and if you don't stop this immigration of Irish
saints," said the unhappy official, "we shall be
eaten up alive." The good King became serious.
Whilst they were talking, a messenger came
with the news that a great batch of saints had
come ashore. The King and his Keeper of the
Victuals&mdash;when there were any to keep&mdash;looked at
each other solemnly. "Put the castle in mourning,"
said the King. When the new arrivals danced
up to the gate, with teeth well set for action
and stomachs empty, the Keeper of the Victuals
spoke sadly. "The good King died," he said,
"the moment he heard that more saints had
arrived. Those who came first ate all his substance
and emptied his keeves, and there was
nothing left of him now but bones. The last
words of the good King were, 'Give them my
bones.'" The Keeper of the Victuals turned, as
though to fetch the good King's bones for the
saints to feast on; but they one and all departed
and spread the story. The King played the
game and ordered his own funeral; and when
the time came, he got up and looked through a
peep-hole to see the procession. "The saints,"
said he, "have spared my bones, but they will
surely come and see the last of me." But he was
mistaken. The story that all the keeves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
empty spread, and there wasn't a "saint" left in
the land on the morrow. Then the King showed
himself to his own people, and a law was passed,
intituled "An Act against Alien Saints' Immigration."
The country recovered its ancient
prosperity, and the Keeper of the Victuals filled
the keeves with salted meats, and there were
wild birds in the air, and beasts in the field, and
the King once more feasted in his own hall.</p>

<p>St. Ia came across the Channel on a cabbage
leaf, and the wind and tide carried her gaily to
King Tewdrig's shore, but when the Customs
asked her what she had to declare, she only held
up the cabbage leaf. As she was a princess in
her own right, and good-looking for an emigrant,
the Customs officers were sad, but showed her
a printed paper, rule xli, which stated that
"foreigners without luggage, or visible means of
subsistence, must not be allowed to land." The
saint pointed to the cabbage leaf, and argued that
it was "luggage" and "visible means of subsistence,"
and would have made good her point
but for the King's Chancellor, who said that the
cabbage leaf, being "pickled," was a manufactured
article, and liable to duty under the new fiscal
regulations. St. Ia always left her purse at home
when she travelled, so she was unable to pay the
duty. Once more she committed herself to the
mercies of the sea on her cabbage leaf, and was
carried to St. Ives, where she landed, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
made much of. She stayed there for a time,
planted her leaf, and was blessed with a wonderful
crop of pickled cabbages, the like of which
had never before been seen or heard of. But
she revenged herself upon King Tewdrig by
writing to all the papers, and the saints, who
deserted the King when they had almost eaten
him up, made a fine how-de-doo, and an "Irish
grievance," and the bad name which they gave
the King stuck to him. The saints wrote the
books in those days, and those who came after
repeated what they wrote, until the people
believed, and called it "history."</p>

<p>Guy said it was very unconstitutional to lay
the fault upon the King, who, it was well known,
could do no wrong. It was the duty of the Prime
Minister to bear all faults, and it was noticeable
that many prime ministers were round-shouldered,
so that they might carry faults lightly.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Battle of St. Breage.</span></p>

<p>The saints and piskies had a battle-royal at
St. Breage. A three-line whip was sent over to
Ireland, and as soon as it was known that there
was a little fighting to do, and a cracked skull
almost certain, for the glory of God, the saints
sent up a shout, straightened their blackthorns,
and came across the water in whole battalions.
The cause was popular. St. Patrick had driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the snakes into the sea, and why not the saints
drive the piskies out of Cornwall? Hooroo!
Paddy's blood was up, and he was spoiling for a
bit of fun. The saints had the best of it, but so
much blood was spilt on both sides that the sand
was turned into stone. There is no other such
stone in the district, and St. Breage had a block
carved into a cross, and set up as a memorial,
which may be seen to this day, only it has a hole
in it which was made by the Giant Golons, who
wore it on his watchchain until the date of his
conversion.</p>

<p>"When anything has to be accounted for in
this land, put it down to the saints, or the piskies,
or Old Artful, and you're sure to be right.
Nothing ever took place in the ordinary course
of things. A month of Cornwall would be enough
to drive a modern scientist stark, staring mad,"
said Guy.</p>

<p>"It would be curious to speculate what sort
of world we should be living in to-day if things
really happened, as they are said to have happened,
between fairies and piskies, saints and
giants, each possessing supernatural powers. And
yet law and custom grew out of beliefs in the
invisible-visible," said the Bookworm.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Story of an Artful Maid.</span></p>

<p>There were women as well as men saints,
and when a woman came to the front she made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
a sensation. St. Agnes was a woman. She
was not born a saint, but became one. She was
christened Ann, plain Ann, and was a good little
girl, with blue eyes, and light brown hair much
given to curl into love locks. She stayed at
home until she grew up, and became restless, and
wanted to see the world for herself. She did not
complain more than other girls that her dresses
were not tailor-made, and she had no particular
grievance, only she felt that she must have a
change. She wrote a dear little note, and enclosed
one of her love locks to her dear and
loving parents, freely forgiving them all the
trouble and expense she had been to them, and
went on her own.</p>

<p>She was supposed to be delicate on the chest,
and Cornwall having a great reputation, she made
all haste to get there. In those days there were
a good many pilgrims on the road who used to
entertain one another with stories of many lands
and their adventures therein, and delicate little
Agnes heard in this way about a famous Cornish
giant, named Bolster. Mr. Bolster was in many
respects a monster, and his story had great
interest for little Agnes, because it was said he
changed his wife every New Year's Day. He
was called "Bolster" because he used to smother
the old ones. Agnes wanted an adventure, and
as her saint-like qualities developed, she felt
more and more drawn towards Mr. Bolster, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
she determined to try her hand upon him. It
was a bold thing; but Agnes was bold, and when
she felt at all timid she said aloud, "Courage!"</p>

<p>Mr. Bolster was a very fine fellow, the
Colossus of his age. When his right foot rested
on the summit of one hill his left foot rested on
the summit of another, and the only thing that
troubled him was corns, and when the weather
changed, sometimes he had such twinges that he
often thought he had a "conscience," and wished
to get rid of it. At other times his conscience
was "passive." Agnes heard about the corns,
and a light played in her eyes of heavenly blue.
She had an idea.</p>

<p>New Year was approaching, and Mr. Bolster
was on the look-out for a fresh partner of his
joys. When Agnes sighted him he was standing
with one foot on Carn Brea and the other on
Beacon, looking at the little virgins round about
playing at "touch." His habit was to make a
selection, watch the young lady home, and then,
at New Years dawn, to carry her off just when
she was busiest dreaming of mince-pies. Agnes
guessed that the psychological moment had come,
so she walked up Carn Brea and tickled Mr.
Bolster's right foot with a bramble, quite close
to his pet corn. Mr. Bolster, thinking that
conscience was at him again, lifted his foot
angrily; but, happily for Agnes, saw her kneeling
at his foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hulloa!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Agnes presented her card.</p>

<div class="box"><p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Beautiful for Ever!</span><br />
<br />
MISS AGNES.<br />
<br />
<i>Corns Extracted, Bunions Attended to.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>Beauty at his feet, and the New Year near.
Corns extracted. Was there ever such luck?
So he took the little maiden up in his arms and
promised, then and there, that she should be the
next Mrs. Bolster. "Not long to wait," he
added with a chuckle, the present Mrs. B. not
having turned out to his liking.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolster had neglected his personal
appearance very much lately, and when he sat
Agnes on his knee in the gloaming, she began
his education. "Beautiful for Ever!" was her
trade mark. If Bolster only wore curls, what
a head! Hyacinthine locks, what an Apollo!
Bolster looked at her dear little love locks, and
then put his great hand over his own hair, which
was long and matted, and began to think that,
after all, short, crisp curls would be an improvement.
He did not surrender at once, but Agnes
said she couldn't, she really couldn't, be the next
Mrs. Bolster and trim his pet corns unless he
had hyacinthine locks, like an up-to-date hero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in a novel. She found a bit of chalk and drew
on a blackboard the head of a Hercules with
Apollo's locks. Mr. Bolster was touched in a
weak spot, and to keep him soft, Agnes vowed
that she would never be Mrs. Bolster until he
was such a man&mdash;such a curled darling.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolster's hair was long and matted, and
Agnes got a rake, and combed and combed until
it all came off, and there was none to curl. New
Year came, and Mrs. Bolster in possession went
the way of all the giant's wives, and Agnes sat
upon Bolster's knee and wept because of her
vow which she must keep&mdash;no curls, no Agnes.
She stroked his bald pate, saying the new hair
was sprouting already, and it would curl so sweet
when short that his own mother wouldn't know
him. Then Agnes put him on health diet to
make him young again, and when his hair really
began to grow she became afraid, for she caught
him heating the curling-tongs in secret, as though
he meant business at an early date.</p>

<p>Agnes sat upon his knee and wept. He was
so stout. She could not clasp his manly waist.
He must reduce&mdash;he must, he must. The tears
were in her beautiful eyes. Once more she
touched the spot, and Mr. Bolster, the Colossus,
was soft. He'd do anything, and then he took
an oath at which the stars trembled.</p>

<p>There was a little basin in the rock which
the giant used for shaving-water now he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
become a dandy. Water trickled down the
crevice into the sea when the cork plug was
removed. Agnes prescribed a little blood-letting&mdash;for
she was skilled in phlebotomy&mdash;"just a
basinful, you know," said she, with great pleading
eyes of heavenly blue. Mr. Bolster threw his
mighty arm carelessly across the basin.</p>

<p>"Only a basinful this time," said Agnes,
pulling out the plug.</p>

<p>"Wake me up when it's full," said Bolster.</p>

<p>He slept and slept, dreaming of Agnes, and
the vital stream flowed and ran down the crevice
into the sea. And Agnes looked over the cliff
and saw the sea blush, and blush deeper still.</p>

<p>"Is it nearly full?" asked Bolster, in a tone
of lazy happiness.</p>

<p>"Not yet&mdash;not yet, my love," said Agnes,
stroking his bald head where the curls were
to grow.</p>

<p>So he slept and woke again, and asked,
"Is it nearly full?"</p>

<p>"Yet a little more; it runs so slowly now,"
said Agnes.</p>

<p>And Bolster slept again.</p>

<p>Agnes looked over the cliff and the sea was
deeply dyed, so great a stream had flowed from
the mighty form, smiling in sleep, but pale in
death.</p>

<p>He woke and tried to rise, but Agnes soothed
him, saying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"But a little more, 'tis nearly to the brim."</p>

<p>And his last vision was of Agnes.</p>

<p>So the land was rid of Bolster; but the
people were not so thankful to Agnes as they
might have been, so she "skipped." She led
a wandering life, making and selling an ointment
which people rubbed over their eyes to make
them see clearer, and her fame followed her, so
people began to praise and dedicate churches
to her. The place where Bolster was slain
became St. Agnes, and the basin into which his
life's blood flowed may be seen to this day. A
pebble thrown in finds its way to the sea if there
is nothing to prevent it.</p>

<p>Guy said he liked to hear stories told on the
spot, things seemed so real. Here was the very
basin which held Bolster's shaving-water before
it became the receiver for his blood. Just as
good being here as reading an illustrated article
in a magazine.</p>

<p>The Bookworm said the story was only one
of a class, and it was quite easy to separate fact
from fiction when we once knew how. In this
case, Bolster was not a real person, but a snow-god,
to whom the people offered a virgin every
New Year to make him melt and let the earth
bring forth her increase. St. Agnes made the
people see the error of their ways&mdash;that was the
ointment which she made for giving people
clearer vision&mdash;and so it was said that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
slain Bolster. She was, no doubt, artful, and was
all the more popular in consequence, it becoming
a saying that "an artful maid is stronger than
Bolster."</p>

<p>Guy said he liked the story best as it was,
and had no patience with the Bookworm's treatment
of it as a myth. He'd put money on
Agnes, he said, to make her way in the world
as well as any twentieth-century woman.</p>

A liking</span> for stories of the saints
grows with the supply. The
Bookworm discovered in them
the makings of history, and
Guy mere love for the marvellous
and dramatic situations.
He thought St. Agnes would work up splendidly.
It is well that saints catch on, because one can't
get away from them. No sooner is one out of
the parish of St. A., than he's into the parish of
St. B., and from St. B. to St. C., and so on
through the alphabet. It must have been a sore
trial to the aborigines to see so many foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
saints upon the soil without visible means of
subsistence, yet claiming exemption from income
tax.</p>

<p>Wherever there was a well a saint took
possession of it. The votive offerings of the
natives to the bright, sparkling divinity dwelling
in springs of water passed into their hands, the
water cures became "miracles," and chapels and
baptistries were built over the wells. Chapels
and hermits' cells abound. There is one spring
which insures a man from hanging if he is but
christened with its water in childhood. There is
another, in which a madman may be ducked until
he is cured; there is another, in which a maiden
may see her "future;" and there are others
which can cure sad souls and sadder bodies.</p>

<p>As things are reckoned now, the best of the
saints did not have a good time. The ruined
chapel in the Saints' Valley was at one time the
residence of a holy man, who never saw human
form, or heard human voice, unless some one in
distress needed his good offices to heal or console
the sick or dying. It was a dark and dreary cell,
with two slits in the walls for light and air, and a
thin stream trickled through, and fell into a rocky
basin outside, now green with fern and lichen.
This feeble stream cut a channel in the rock, so
we thought the cell must be pretty old; but there
was no niche, or anything to show that lamp or
image swung from the roof, or nestled somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to cheer the poor man. Whoever he was, he
left no trace, not even a scratch in the rock
recording his name. We would not have been
much the wiser, after all, even if we had known
the name of the poor human who endured torture
here, and had the courage to live, and not throw
himself to the first wolves who came howling
around.</p>

<p>The ideas conjured up were unpleasant, and
Guy gave a shout when he got outside, just to be
sure that he was himself. He was sure, he said,
no penal settlement in the world possessed a
solitary system so depressingly solitary as this.
He was quite prepared to take an affidavit
neither now, nor at any time, to go in for honours
in saintship.</p>

<p>The Bookworm said stories of the saints made
what we saw much more interesting than if we
merely looked at them through the eyes of guide-books.
There was the "Cheese-wring." What
did Murray say? Just this&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This remarkable object consists of tabular
blocks of granite heaped one upon the other, after
the manner of cheeses, to the height of twenty-four
feet, but has probably acquired its name
from its supposed resemblance to the press
employed in the preparation of cider.... It
derives its extraordinary appearance from the
circumstance of the stones at the base being less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
than half the size of those they support, which are
ten or twelve feet in diameter. Hence, the shape
of the pile is that of a huge fungus, with a stalk
so slenderly proportioned for the weight of the
head, that the spectator will find it hard to divest
himself of the idea of its instability."</p></blockquote>

<p>He had, he said, made notes of a short
story which accounted for the fantastic mass of
weathered granite in quite a different way, and
made of the stone a lasting memorial of the
triumph of the saints over the early giants in the
land&mdash;faith against strength.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">St. Tue and the Giants.</span></p>

<p>The story opened at a period when the saints
had been some time in the land, and the people
took kindly to them, and brought them fish on
Fridays. The giants grew jealous, and resolved
on holding a conference, and when they were all
assembled, Uther was voted to the chair, because
he had the broadest shoulders and the best headpiece
of all the race from the Tamar to Pol-Pedyn.
The question was, What shall we do
with the saints? Various methods had been
already tried&mdash;boiling, baking, and grilling were
no use. The giants were not a united family,
and were fond of hurling rocks at one another,
and fighting and wrestling for fun or glory, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
as the humour prompted. Uther, the president,
put the matter before them in a statesmanlike
way. First of all, he counted six up, and then
he counted half a dozen; then he said, if you
take six from six, there's nothing, but if you wipe
out six, six remains. The speech was so precise
and clear, that it was pencilled down on a half-sheet
of notepaper, and, in time, became the
model for future prime ministers. It was certainly
very well received. Then there was a
discussion, and some said one thing, and some
another, and when all spoke at once, it was very
difficult to know what was said or meant. The
president tried to keep order, but was just as
helpless as Mr. Speaker in modern days. Fortunately
it was an open-air meeting, and the sky
was not cracked.</p>

<p>Saint Tue had a little well all to himself, but
was a small and weakly man, who took cod-liver
oil fasting; but he was young and full of zeal.
The conference was held in what he called his
"sphere of influence," and when he heard the
mighty shouts, he looked upwards and saw a sign.
Then he hastened to the conference, and, by
dodging in and out between the giants' legs,
he managed to reach the president, who was
threatening to leave the chair unless better order
was kept.</p>

<p>"Pick me up," said St. Tue.</p>

<p>So Uther picked him up and showed him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the assembly; and, being a strong man himself,
he admired pluck.</p>

<p>"What do you want here, my little man?"
asked Uther, thinking into which pocket he
should pop him to ensure his safety.</p>

<p>"I want to challenge you to a trial of strength;
but let me speak to the giants," replied the saint.</p>

<p>Uther stood St. Tue on the palm of his hand
and held out his arm, so that he might speak,
which he did in a loud voice, telling them solemnly
that they were warring against heaven and one
mightier than they, and finished by challenging
the mightiest to a contest of rock-hurling. If he
were beaten, all the saints would leave the land;
but if he won, then the giants were to cease their
persecution and be baptized with the sign of the
cross.</p>

<p>Now, Uther was a champion rock-hurler, and
it was a pastime with him to throw rocks like
quoits, and so truly as to balance them one over
the other, the top being the largest. The game
was no child's play; and the assembly said if
Uther would accept the challenge, they would
abide by the result. When they looked at St.
Tue and the rocks to be hurled, they laughed
mockingly.</p>

<p>There were twelve rocks in all. They had
been used before, and were fairly round. The
smallest was hurled first, and Uther pitched it
one hundred feet. St Tues knees shook. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
if his faith should fail now? He cast his eyes
upwards, and then, oh, blessed miracle! the rock
was as a feather in his hand, and he hurled it
with such precision that it capped number one as
though it grew there.</p>

<p>So the game went on, and the pile grew more
and more like a mushroom. The giants shouted
mightily when Uther's rock capped the saint's;
but when the saint's capped Uther's, they groaned
aloud, and showed temper.</p>

<p>It was the saint's turn to hurl the last rock,
which, being the heaviest and largest, and having
to be thrown the highest, required the greatest
skill and judgment and strength. The slightest
error, and the pile would topple over. The
silence was so great that a grasshopper was heard
to chirp. True as a die the rock settled on the
rest, and the whole mass swayed upon its stem,
but fell not.</p>

<p>The victory was not yet, and a thirteenth
rock was brought, and so huge was it that the
giant knew it was beyond his powers to hurl; but
he raised it with both hands and threw it with all
his might and strength, and fell prone to earth,
exhausted. The rock fell short, and was rolled
back to where St. Tue stood, trembling once
again. Would Heaven fail him now? But no.
His eyes were opened, and he saw an angelic
host raise the stone to his hand, carry it through
the air, and place it as a crown upon the "wring,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
that man might wonder at for evermore. But
the giants were blind with rage, and saw not.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;"><a id="i109"></a>
<img src="images/i_109.jpg" width="387" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE LEGEND OF THE CHEESE-WRING.</div>
</div>

<p>Then Uther bowed his head in humility and
confessed his sins, and was baptized; and some
followed his example, but more returned to their
castles and did what scathe they could. But the
saints rejoiced when they heard what St. Tue had
done, and were made free of the land; and made
so free with it that all the best they took to themselves,
and so pursued the giants with soap and
water and Sunday clothes, and so trimmed their
beards and nails, that the race dwindled and
dwindled and died out. So the saints triumphed,
and the Cheese-wring is their memorial.</p>

<p>St. Tue founded the "Union of Saints," and
then his troubles began in such earnest that he
had to increase his doses of cod-liver oil in order
to bear them. He was nursed in his last days by
the good St. Keyne, who came over from Wales
for the purpose. An elm, an oak, and an ash
tree grew over his grave, whose roots formed an
arch, and under the arch a spring of pure water
gushed forth. So St. Keyne lived by the well,
and Cornish brides, drinking first of the water,
wear divided skirts, and feed their husbands with
long spoons.</p>

<p>Guy said he thought we had had enough of
saints, both he and she, for the present.</p>

The</span> Cornish taste has not hitherto
rioted in "graven images."
Ancient monuments were so
plentiful that it may have been
thought quite unnecessary to add
to the number in any shape or
form, especially when it was known that the finest
monoliths were split up and carted away for gate-posts
for cattle to rub against; or, worse than all,
be burnt for lime. However, graven images are
rare in the county. A good citizen of Edinburgh
or Glasgow would put all the statuary in the
county in his back garden. Sir Humphry Davy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
stands outside the market at Penzance, and
Richard Lander, the plucky African traveller, is
skied on a Doric column on the top of a hill in
Truro. Foote, the comedian, Polwhele, county
historian, and Henry Martyn, the sainted missionary,
over whose barren love story and early
death rivers of salt tears have flowed, were all
born in Truro; but we didn't see any graven
images recording the fact. Guy sought information
from an intelligent policeman, who said he
knew Henry Martyn well, and a quiet man he was,
when sober! There are some capital sites in the
city for a few statues to Cornish worthies, and the
effigy of the sainted Martyn would, at all events,
help to preserve his memory from sad imputations.
There is a Cornish flavour about the great
Earl of Chatham, who should have been born at
the family mansion at Boconnoc instead of at
Westminster, where his mother happened to be;
and a Cornish flavour, too, about the gifted Lady
Hester Stanhope, who did not forget to speak
well of Cornish miners, "on account of their
race," in her Syrian home. Cousin Jack might
remember this, and shell out liberally, if the public
fancy runs one day towards statues. The Molesworths
have a claim to be set up in marble, and
so has Richard Trevithick, the Camborne miner,
and so also John Couch Adams, the discoverer of
the planet Neptune. These are a few worthies
to go on with, and by the time their statues are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
unveiled some, now living, may be ripe for immortality
in stone. The few modern monuments are
not remarkable, as such. The Gilbert monument,
at Bodmin, outgrew its strength, and is not likely
to startle remote posterity as a nineteenth-century
antiquity. Once upon a time there was a battle
at Stamford Hill, not far from Bude, when Sir
Bevill Grenvill and his stalwarts gave the Roundheads
a fair drubbing. Then a monument was
erected to record the historic event, and it tumbled
down. Sir Bevill Grenvill had a giant servant,
named Anthony Payne, and the great Kneller
painted his portrait, and the canvas has a place of
honour in the museum of the Royal Institution.
The Bookworm remarked that it was not at all
singular that the county had turned out no sculptors,
when public bodies did so little to encourage
art, and that what they did was done so badly.</p>

<p>Truro is not the capital of the county, though
many people think it ought to be. It has a
cathedral now, which counts for something, and is
the home of the "classy" people, which counts
for a great deal when the question is one of
capital with a big C. Every few years there is a
battle-royal over the capital question, and the
archæologists and the antiquarians dust each
other with seals and charters, Domesday Books
and inquisitions, and all the rest of it. The grand
tournament is between Bodmin and Launceston,
which latter possesses an old castle, or what is left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of one, and was anciently the place for the hanging
of criminals for capital offences. But as the judges
were served with small beer at dinner, and their
beds were not properly aired, they moved on to
Bodmin, where the beer was stronger, and the
bed-linen better looked after. Besides, the tallow
candles gave better light in the Bodmin than in
the Launceston lodgings, which was important to
judges on circuit, when they had to sit up late
and read papers, and "note up" evidence badly
written with their own hand and bad pens. The
Launceston people didn't seem to care much about
their privileges at the time of losing them. In
fact, they were just then feeling sore at having lost
one member of Parliament under the Reform Bill,
and the market was flat for honours which didn't
mean cash in hand. Then Bodmin took on the
assizes, and the hangings, and became the capital
with a big C, and built a lunatic asylum and a
jail, up to date. The question now is whether
our Gracious Lord the King would hold out a
little finger to the Mayor of Launceston or to the
Mayor of Bodmin as most truly representing the
capital of Cornwall. The point has to be settled.
Then Truro comes in and laughs at both, and,
pointing to its cathedral, says, "If you want a
capital with a big C, look here," which pleases all
the "classy" people, and sets the rest laughing,
except the ancient Britons of Penzance, who
swagger about climate, also with a big C. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
climate and capital both begin with C, it is easy
to argue that they are very much alike. Bodmin
and Launceston tilt in rusty armour, and Truro
and Penzance with bodkins, and no harm is done.</p>

<p>The Bookworm made a tour of the libraries
and museums, and somewhere met a "kindred
soul," which so pleased him that he pronounced
Truro the literary town in the duchy. Certainly,
the city has a professorial air, which is native. If
ever there is a Cornish university it will come to
Truro, if it walk upon crutches to get there.
Caps and gowns taking snuff and looking lexicons
coming out of the shadow of Church Lane
would be as natural as life; and then the undergrads
swelling Boscawen Street in term! They
are not there just now, but the place looks as
though cut out for academic maternity. The professorial
air belonged to the place before the
cathedral was dreamt of&mdash;perhaps the cathedral
came because the place had the right sort of style
about it. There is a county look about the shops
in Boscawen Street, which is all its own. Some
of the shops just put up wire blinds, with a legend
painted on them, discouraging to the vulgar
looking for bargains and misfits. "Nothing of
the sort here; our customers write cheques, you
know." There are other shops with "discount
for cash" writ large all over them, but they seem
out of place, somehow. There was always this sort
of county family style about the town and people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
who were always fond of sports, and had a
cock-pit.</p>

</div>

<p>What strikes the stranger first is the inexhaustible
water supply. Miniature canals ripple along
on both sides of the streets&mdash;clear, bright, fresh
water, which would be worth no end of money in
a thirsty land. Ripple, ripple, ripple, all day long,
and all the year through, never overflowing, never
drying up, a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.
Hydrophobia is unknown amongst dogs, and is
only observable amongst the higher animals&mdash;generally
on pay days and holidays. The inhabitants,
however, pay water taxes quite cheerfully,
and are not extravagant users in their houses. It
is a reproach to Londoners, who are so extravagant
with water, to see how thrifty the people are.
The people of Helston are blessed with water
running free in the same way.</p>

<p>Cornish people do not live much in towns;
they seem to prefer living amongst the rocks and
trees, upon the downs, amongst the shadows of
they know not what, and sounds which are as
echoes from long ago. A very small town elsewhere
fills the untravelled with amazement; and
stories are told of the cunning which was shown
by an old man who carried a piece of chalk in his
pocket and placed a mark on the corner of every
street he turned, and so made his way plain when
he wished to return; but the poor fellow was
sadly puzzled when a joker rubbed out his marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and put facsimiles in wrong places. But, in
truth, Cornish towns are not very puzzling to an
ordinary pavement trotter, and the houses are
not much to look at. Solid walls pierced with
holes and covered by a roof is a "house." There
are whole streets like this in all the towns, and
most of the shops have the appearance of being
private houses "accommodated." In a land
where the Ph&oelig;nician and Greek came, and the
Roman dwelt; where Spaniard, Frenchman, and
Fleming settled, leaving their names and blood
behind, one might expect to find specimens of
the architecture of many periods and countries;
but it is no use looking for what does not exist.
The Cornish never seem to have invited the envy
and hatred of others by the outward beauty of
their dwellings. The Fore Street of a town,
however ancient and celebrated for riches and
commerce, never gives one the idea that merchant
princes dwelt here, and loved to dwell in earthly
tabernacles with polished beams, and hanging
galleries, and oriel windows, painted, decorated,
and varnished, as we see in many a High Street,
in many a town in the rest of England. The
Cornish genius had no great turn for architecture&mdash;its
municipal buildings are plain and thrifty,
like the dwelling-houses. To be "wind and
water tight" is the native idea of comfort; and
then plenty of whitewash and a little paint. There
must have been native artists in abundance during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the centuries, but they were seldom employed
with chisel and brush in decorating private dwellings
or corporation buildings. The county turned
out one little painter who "mixed his colours
with brains," and so became the rage for a London
season; but when you come to a town, don't
inquire, "What artist was born here?" The old
people didn't throw away money on decorative
art. If there is a bit to be found anywhere, it
is generally in or about a church, and stranger
fingers executed it.</p>

<p>On the moors, and on the coast, the idea of a
dwelling is that of a stone hut with window and
chimney, not so very much in advance of the
dwellings of the Palæolithic Age, which shows how
slow the evolution of one idea may be whilst
others are travelling at motor pace. Where
stone abounds the dwelling is a cave above the
ground; where stone is scarce the yellow earth
is mixed with a little chopped straw, and makes
a wall as much like the neighbouring soil as peas
in a pod. This is "cob" wall, and, when covered
with thatch and half hidden with flowering
creepers, cob-wall cottages are pleasant to look
at. Specimens of stone dwellings with thatched
roofs abound in the Lizard district, and cob-wall
cottages, more or less in ruins, are almost everywhere.
Men and women are in the habit of
leaving their boots and clogs outside their dwellings,
and when the doors are open there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
great display of old crockery and china ornaments
in stiff-looking cupboards with glass doors. Very
like a painting by a Dutch artist is the interior of
a Cornish cottage on a moor.</p>

<p>Old fishing towns which have not yet been
too much "improved" show the practical side of
the Cornishman's mind in the matter of dwellings.
The idea of a street never occurred to him. What
he wanted was a place on shore in which to store
his nets and fishing gear, sails and spars, and
over that a loft, which he divided into rooms
fitted up with "lockers," like the cuddy of his
boat, or the cabin of a ship, and that was his
castle. He reached the ground by means of
stone or wooden steps, having the appearance on
land of steps let down from the gangway of a
ship. In fact, the idea of a dwelling was that of
a ship in stone, and the similarity was the greater
when a "hatch" was lifted up in the kitchen and
descent made into the cellar below, just as one
would descend into the hold of a ship through
the open hatchway. The Cornish fisher's idea of
comfort was snugness. His dwelling overlooked
the harbour, and he could see his boat lying to
her moorings, and open his window and talk to
the men as they passed, and consult the sky and
clouds. He could do a lot from his window, his
chin resting on his arms, with the least possible
trouble to himself. When a fisher cannot live so
as to see the harbour from his window, he lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
as near the harbour as he can, so as to be out of
his boat and into his bed in the shortest time.
He detests walking one step further than he can
help after he lands, so the idea of regular streets
never dawned upon the original builders of Newlyn
and St. Ives, Polperro and Looe, Fowey and
Mevagissey. A street is an accident, unless it is
modern&mdash;the ancient builders of the old towns
deeming it sufficient to leave a gangway between
the houses, as at Polperro, where a man with
broad shoulders can block up the whole thoroughfare.
In the villages and coves at the Lizard and
the Land's End, the fishers' dwellings have a
physiognomy in common, and tell of struggle
and endurance; and in favoured places, jasmine
and myrtle, fuchsia, geranium, and roses step
in and cover all the weather-beaten stone and
shabby lintels with glory and perfume.</p>

St. Ives</span> is small for its age, but
is growing now. The town
divides itself into two parts, the
new and the old. The new is
new, and the old is fragrant.
The history of St. Ives also
divides itself into two, the ancient and the modern;
and the ancient goes back to the time of the
saints. It was a woman who founded St. Ives.
It is well to keep this in mind, because the well-known
St. Ives was a lawyer, and so honest that
he was never once struck off the rolls. Some of
the piety of the ancient lady is said to linger
about the town. It was she who introduced a
new breed of cats, and the old town is still famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
for cats. There are Manx cats and Persian cats
and St. Ives cats. The St. Ives cat is "at home"
in the streets, and may be found in corners and
on doorsteps, or stretched at full length across
the roads, and sidewalks when there are any.
St. Ives is apparently owned by cats, so respectful
are the inhabitants, and so careful not
to tread on their tails or toes. If a cat is stretched
out enjoying the sunshine, a man will drive his
cart around it, to the danger of humans paying
rates and taxes. The St. Ives cat has a well-to-do,
lascivious-looking air, and is only properly
awake at nights. In the daytime the animal
slinks along courts and side streets, and rubs
itself against water-butts and tar-barrels and fish-flaskets,
until it has an odour of mixed scents as
strong as a distillery of perfumes. Nothing can
beat pilchard oil mixed with garbage, which the
St. Ives cat loves. When the boats return in
the early hours of the morning, the cats make
tracks for the quay, and every cat knows its own
boat, and waits for the men to come ashore, and
then purrs and purrs, and rubs its scented fur
against the men's long-boots. The men belong
to the cats, every cat a man and every man a cat.
Women and mice don't count much with St. Ives
cats&mdash;it's men and fish for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Smiler's Pious Cat.</span></p>

<p>"Ded 'ee ever hear th' story of Smiler's cat?
No? Well, then, I'll tell 'ee," said a man, gutting
a fish upon an iron post, and throwing tid-bits to
a long lanky tabby with one mild blue eye and
one a dark grassy green. "He wadn't a fighter,
egcept he was provoked, and then he was game;
but he was a most orderly cat and pious. Now
you may laugh, but ef iver there was a pious cat,
'twas Smiler's. Smiler wadn't pious, but Bob was.
Bob was black with a white tie round his neck, so
he had a respectable appearance, and was looked
up to by all the cats in the parish. Bob knew
when Smiler had a good week, and knew where
to find him when he'd had enough and 'twas time
to go home. Smiler was a peaceful man at all
times, and when he'd had full 'lowance, and more,
he'd sit down and talk over old times, and his
father and mother, and begin to cry. Then Bob
would rub against his legs and make for the door,
and Smiler would follow 'zackly like a cheeld&mdash;ess
he would. When 'twas dark Bob 'ud walk back-'ards
and show Smiler the way by the light of es
eyes&mdash;starboard and port, port and starboard&mdash;till
Smiler got home. Bob was that pious he
wouldn't eat no vish on a Sunday, and he was so
looked up to by all the cats that not one would
run down to the quay on a Saturday or a Sunday
night&mdash;not sure 'nuff&mdash;not if all the boats came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
in chock-vull of vish. 'No Sunday vish for St.
Ives!' was the motto with Bob, and all the cats
followed. Smiler was that happy on Saturdays
that he cudn't rise on Sundays, and Bob used to
keep watch and listen to the Salvation Army
services which he cud hear quite plain through
the open window. Bob got to like the music
and grew serious, and tuk to followin' th' band.
People tuk notice, and said 'twas Smiler's Bob,
and expected to see Smiler foller the cat, as he
did at nights when he was well 'bowsed.'</p>

<p>"Bob was going after Smiler one night, as
usual, after 'sharing,' and, as ill fortune would
have it, he met an old friend in the cat-line, and
they went off together, which was sad for Smiler,
who went wrong, and slipped into the water,
without being seen or heard. Bob went about
like a mazed cat, and never rested till he sniffed
out Smiler, caught by a mooring chain. It was
wonderful to see Bob follerin' at the funeral, and
many would have taken care ov him, but he had
a 'call,' and follered the Salvation Army, and to
the last day of his innocent life would eat no vish
on a Sunday&mdash;not no vish even caught on a
Saturday; no risks for Bob. If some people was
only as good as some cats," said the man, resuming
work and throwing a morsel to the long lanky
tabby, "why, then I say there'd be no call for
bad blood between East and West on the score
of Sunday fishing and Sunday markets."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you account for this uncommon
piety in a cat?" asked Guy.</p>

<p>"'Twas bred in him, s'poase. Anyhow, he
was uncommon pious, and his good example is
follered. Thiccy theer cat wud no more ate vish
catched on Sunday than he'd fly. Wad'ee, Tom?"</p>

<p>Tom purred.</p>

<p>"I knawed it," said the man, washing the fish
and pushing his forefinger through its gills.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The St. Ives women always enjoyed the reputation
of being well endowed with tongue.
Some people think their old vivacity is the result
of foreign blood, but it is singular that the "gift"
of tongue should follow only in the female line.
A St. Ives man is quiet enough until his blood is
up, and then he wants to hit something, or throw
something overboard, and make a big noise in
the open air. There is the story of three young
women slipping into their pattens and going to
the well with their pitchers for water. Their
husbands were at sea. The young women began
to talk, and they talked on and on until their
husbands returned, and found them just at the
beginning of an argument. So they off to sea
once more, and back again, and the three women
were still at the well, and getting interested in
the argument. Then the three men took a long
voyage, and returning with well-lined purses
found their wives, now grown white, still at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
well, but on the point of adjourning till the
morrow to take up the thread of the old argument.</p>

<div class="caption">A CORNISH FISH WIFE.</div>
</div>

<p>The St. Ives woman, however, has a turn for
business. What her man catches she sells, and
pays his bills for nets and barking and repairs.
On land she's "boss," and has a "sharing cake"
once a week when she settles accounts. The
"sharing cake" is an ancient institution, and must
be respected. It has its ceremonial, too, and
must be broken with the fingers, not cut with a
knife, because cold steel would bring bad luck.
The customs of women are very different in the
North and South. Like Newlyn, St. Ives is the
home of artists of world-wide reputation.</p>

A Cornish</span> Sunday to a man of
cities is a weariness to the flesh,
and a temptation to pray for
Monday to come quickly; but for
the natives it is a blessed day&mdash;a
day of feathers and soft down,
a day for chewing the cud and being lazy without
reproach. The fishermen rarely fish on Saturdays
because the sacred idleness of the Sunday may be
broken by the salesmen and railway porters&mdash;so
the day of rest is made to stretch over as much
of two days as is worth the having. Farmers are
not so well off as fishers, but do what they can in
the resting line, and that is something. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
we walked through any of the villages on a
Sunday we found the people mostly looking over
their garden gates, casting glances "up-along,"
or "down-along," or "athwart," just to see what
was going on, and who was moving. They don't
like cycles or cyclists on Sundays, and when one
comes along all the men in their shirt-sleeves,
and all the women helping them to do nothing,
squirm as though wounded in a tender place.
Every time it is the same&mdash;the same inward
shrinking from activity on a day of rest. Those
who do nothing all the week feel just the same,
and lie about, and squat about, indoors, when not
outside resting their ample chins upon ample
arms upon gates and walls, staring "up-along,"
and "down-along," and "athwart," watching one
another.</p>

<p>Whatever can sleep, sleeps, and the people
don't seem properly awake until after tea, when
the women make ready for chapel, and the men
go after them. The men wouldn't stir but for
the women, and the women make a bee-line for
chapel. Sunday is given up to preaching and
preachers. If you see a man driving on a
Sunday, you may put him down for a "local"
brother, who works at his trade all the week and
is preacher on Sundays. You may know him by
a certain smile of goodness that plays around his
mouth, for he is going to have a good time. The
lay preacher is a by-product of Methodism, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
valuable one in large and scattered circuits too
poor for anything but a little chapel of four walls
and a brush of whitewash. The Methodist clergy
live in the towns and work around the circuit, so
the people in the villages see their minister sometimes.
The ordained minister is a "rounder,"
because of his travelling round. The lay, or
"local," brothers come in and fill up gaps, and
they travel from place to place according to a
"plan"&mdash;a sort of calendar and time-table combined.
It is a system, and it works, and congregations
are not wearied with the same face and
voice two Sundays in succession. It is good for
the lay brother, who can run one sermon for
three months without much fear of being bowled
out.</p>

<p>The lay preacher is almost a professional once
a week, and goes so far as to wear a clerical
bowler, but the white necktie is reserved, as a
rule, for his betters. There is no written law
upon the subject, but it is understood that the
white necktie is for the professional "rounder."
The lay brother has privileges, and may drive
proudly through the land of saints on Sundays
and be welcomed, though no one else may let or
hire a trap for love or money. The lay brother
may not ride a bicycle, which is a pity, looked at
from the side of horseflesh.</p>

<p>"I'll drive 'ee to plaize 'ee, but I'd rather
not," said a good-tempered landlord, one Sunday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
when we wished to pay respects to an ancient
monument.</p>

<p>"Why would you rather not?"</p>

<p>"People talk so, and say nasty things to the
children."</p>

<p>"But some one has just driven past, and
every one smiled and how-de-doo'd him."</p>

<p>"That's oal right. He's goin' to praich."</p>

<p>"But the pony looked tired."</p>

<p>"I shud zay so. Six mile and stiffish hills,
and not wance ded ee git out ov th' trap."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that a preacher of the Gospel
over-drives his horse?"</p>

<p>"I mane that ef a hill is as stiff as a house a
praicher won't never walk on a Zunday&mdash;not wan
inch of th' way."</p>

<p>Now the vent-peg was out, our host's
eloquence ran freely, and much he said of the
over-driving and under-feeding of hired horses
by lay preachers on Sundays, and of the reluctance
which people had to take on the "horse
hire" contracts for the Sunday work, because the
men who walked the hills fast enough in their
weekday clothes would not walk an inch in their
Sunday clothes when "planned" for preaching.
A false standard of dignity this, which made men
cruel. And then the under-feeding? There is
no excuse for this. The lay brother is served

of the cross, and should not forget the hard-working
little animal which has dragged him the
whole distance, and will have to drag him back
again, and the worse the weather the quicker the
pace.</p>

<p>Lay preaching is the homely fare of Sunday
congregations, who thrive on it because it
suits them and sticks in their memories. The
"higher criticism" is not wanted by them. Here
are a few specimens, picked up in various places.</p>

<p>"You'll never want friends whilst you've God
and your victuals."</p>

<p>"Some people's religion is like badly baked
dough&mdash;put in with the bread and took out with
the cakes."</p>

<p>"What the Bible says is true, as true as I've
a-got specketty stockings on."</p>

<p>"I do pity the poor ould devil, he lost such a
good plaace oal dru catching a cold en es faith.
Ess, my dears, he was like some folks along weth
we, who get boilin' hot when they'm convarted,
and then catch chill dru sittin' en a draught."</p>

<p>"There was wance a great man who gave a
great supper to a braave lot of guests. And
ded'm come? Not for sure, but they all sent
excuses. Wan said, 'I've boughten a piece of
land, an' must go an' try et;' an' another said,
'I've boughten vive yoke of oxen, an' must try
they;' an' another said, 'I've married a wife, an'
must stap to home to try she.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cast your bread upon the waters, and
doan't 'ee luk fust to see whichee way th' wind es
blawing. Aw, my dears, there's many a man
wean't trust the Loard weth a penny loaf, and so
they lose the blessing, like ould Timothy Tack,
who spent sixpence to find thrupence."</p>

<p>"Love your neighbour, that is a commandment;
but ef you b'lieve in him he's sure to
do 'ee!"</p>

<p>"Some people say, 'You can't believe a
thing unless you can see and feel it;' but I say
you can. Look 'ee now. Here's my hand&mdash;fowr
fingers an' a thum'. Well, that's fact, edn't et?
Now then" (hiding his hand from view), "my
hand has got fowr fingers an' a thum', but you
can't see'm. Well, that's b'leef. Never say,
then, you can't b'lieve what you can't see and
feel."</p>

<p>"When I was a boy, a man used to come
round crying 'Bellows to mend,' and the schoolmaster
our way put up a sign, 'Manners to mend.'
Now, I think we might put up that sign in
chapels where people come on Sundays trapesing
in as though they were going by train, and
quattin' down, and spittin' on th' floor, for oal th'
world 'twas a tiddly-wink. Them's manners to
mend, sure 'nuff, an' would be th' better for
mendin', like Jakey Luney's britches, ragged
behind."</p>

<p>Sometimes the local brother's homily is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
pointed, but no offence is taken. The preacher
is one of themselves, and they will take a lot from
him in good part. If a stranger were to take the
same liberty there would be trouble. Here is
a specimen from an address spoken from the
pulpit in the free-and-easy manner of every-day
conversation.</p>

<p>"You wean't get into heaven just because
you've a pious mother or a pious father. Not
for sure. Now, I'll tell 'ee a story about a man
who deceived moast everybody when he was in
the flesh, and he liked chateing so much that he
al'ys prayed loudest after he'd tooked in somebody&mdash;an'
there's more like'n down along weth
we now. We'll just give him a name, an' call
him Jim Tresidder. He was on the 'plan,' like
me, and people said 'twas good to hear him hold
forth, and I s'poase 'twas. Jim put a bold face
upon it when he marched up to the golden gate,
and rapped weth his knuckles upon the little
shutter, till Peter looked out. 'Who ar'ee?'
asks Peter. 'Doan't 'ee knaw me? Why, I'm
Jim Tresidder.' Then he tunied up a bit, and
began to sing, 'Heaven is my home.' Now,
Peter must have liked the look of Jim&mdash;he had
sich a pious look weth un, for he stretched forth
his hand for the key hanging over his head to
open the gate weth. 'I'm oal right now,' thinks
Jim, singing louder and louder. 'Avoor I let 'ee
in,' says Peter, 'I'll have a look at the book,' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
he turned over the leaves till he came to the
T's. 'You'm Jim Tresidder of Trevalsa,' ses he.
'Ess,' says Jim. 'Then I'm sorry for 'ee,' says
Peter, hanging up the key wance more. Then
he showed Jim the book through the peep-hole,
and when he seed oal the people he'd chated, and
the evil he had caused, his heart sank into his
shoes. 'I'll live in a dark corner, anywhere, if
you'll only let me in. My poor mother is waiting
for me. She was called Jane, an' was pious&mdash;now
do 'ee lev me in, there's a dear man,' ses he,
the great tears rolling down his chacks. 'Your
mother is here weth the shining ones,' says Peter,
'but you caan't come in because of she, no, f'y,
you caan't, for up here every fish do hang by his
own gills. And you will hang too&mdash;on the
outside.'"</p>

<p>The county is honeycombed with dissent, and
the fat of the land is labelled "Wesleyan." The
beneficed clergy are beautifully housed, with
gardens and stables, and all the appointments of
gentlemen; but the "livings" are not fat. Some
country clergy take "paying guests," and some
let their houses in the summer. The orthodox
Wesleyan ministers are fairly well off, and live
rent free; and the others live as best they can,
and get commissions on the sale of books and
periodicals. One of the brethren left a record of
thirty thousand teeth drawn during his professional
career. As a rule, they "draw" well, and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
draw coin from the most unlikely places. A child
having swallowed a piece of silver, the doctor, in
despair, sent for the minister, saying the case was
hopeless if he failed to get it. The coin was
recovered.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>There is a good deal of "religion" to be met
with, and not so much need for Salvation Army
music as in some places. There are certain times
when people want to feel good, but they don't all
feel the same way at the same time, which saves
monotony. They say that at St. Agnes the people
start being good when the cold weather sets in,
and the feeling lasts until potato-planting time,
and then, somehow, the good feeling sloughs off.
I don't know what becomes of it, only it is put
on one side for the next season, just like a boy
puts on one side his bag of marbles and brings
out tops. It's the same boy, but a new game.
In the summer it's a struggle to be good anywhere,
there's so many fairs and feasts and frolics,
and the young men and maidens are so fond of
courting on the cliffs and downs. It's the custom
of the country and suits well enough, so strangers
may turn their heads on one side&mdash;it's none of
their business. In the autumn the good feeling
comes again and extends along the coast, especially
when the fishing is "slight." The young
men get tired of the maidens about this time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
want to be good for evermore, and the want grows
with the badness of the season. One sign of
goodness in the country is thrift. The man who
neither chews, nor smokes, nor drinks beer, and
who never spends a copper without looking on
both sides of it, is sure to be good.</p>

<p>You always know when the good season is
coming on by the people singing. They are
pretty good, in spots, at singing, but the "gift,"
as they call it, is not universal. A gift is supposed
to run in families, and a man with the voice of
a crow will insist on singing because his great-grandfather
once played the double bass in a
church choir. There is a musical zone in the
West, and the young women who work in the
open air have very sweet voices. These are
the "bal" maidens, and work on the dressing-floors
of the mines. When the time comes round
for them to feel good they "tuney up" a bit, and
take the young men who work underground along
with them to the love-feasts and prayer-meetings
in the little Bethels scattered all about the moors.</p>

<p>They call themselves "Weslums" when they
are not something ending in "ists" or "ite," and
are bursting with goodness every Whit-Monday,
just as sure as the day comes round. Why Whit-Monday
more than any other day in the year
would puzzle any one who did not know that on
a certain day the cuckoo must sing. It's a sort of
something which makes the bird sing, and it's a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of something which makes the "Weslums" feel
good on Whit-Monday, and draws them with
invisible bands towards Gwennap Pit. Whit-Monday
is the anniversary of an occasion when
John Wesley, <i>the</i> John Wesley, <i>our</i> John Wesley
preached in the pit&mdash;- not the pit as it is, but the
pit as it was.</p>

<p>John Wesley wouldn't know the pit, or the
people who flock there now on Whit-Mondays.
The old pit was an abandoned mine of no particular
shape, but inclined to be round, like a
bowl warped in the firing. Then the miners
came with pickaxe and shovel, and cut terraces
against the land, and made the ring quite round,
with its terraces rising one above another, until
it became a sort of county monument to which
the "Weslums" are drawn in their tens of
thousands as to a shrine. John Wesley is a
"Saint" in Cornwall, and all those who went
before him have to take back seats; and Whit-Monday,
at the Pit, is now a sort of religious
carnival, with picnic combined, at which Saint
John would have shied when in the flesh, like
good St. Anthony at a Pleasant Sunday Afternoon,
with fiddles and a ballet. When Wesley
first came among the people they had an unpleasant
trick of throwing stones and turves at
him, and hustling him out of one parish into
another, and then out upon the downs, where he
might live upon frosty turnips when there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
no blackberries. "Starring" in the country was
not pleasant at times; and cold, wet, and starving,
the little-great man often had the appearance of
a scarecrow riding upon a tough little nag as
starved as himself. But he caught on, and
emptied the cock-pit and wrestling ring, and
provided entertainments wherein were mighty
wrestlings with the invisible for immortal stakes.
So he reached the natural cravings of a dramatic
people for excitement and scenic change, and
made them actors, with the blue heavens above,
the earth trembling, and the hill-sides lined with
living faces, wet and radiant. Greater than he
have tramped the county since, but conditions
have altered, and only <i>one</i> Wesley is possible.
And that is why people are drawn as to a shrine
to Gwennap Pit, and the feeling comes upon
them every Whit-Monday that they must go
there, for there is a troubling of the waters then,
and they may be healed. The old spirit of
votive offerings survives in the land of saints and
holy wells.</p>

<p>The Cornish must have been a very well-meaning
folk at one time, estimated by the
number of churches which they built. They
built little else, perhaps, but they did build good
and substantial churches, mostly with square
towers and four pinnacles, to be seen of men far
and near. In the parish of Paul, near Penzance,
the towers of fifteen parish churches may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
counted from one spot, and, though not so thick
everywhere, the minds of the people centred
around the churches for more reasons than one.
In the old days, when roads were few and
detestably bad, people reckoned church towers
as guides, and calculated distances from church
tower to church tower. Every man who ventured
far from home knew the church towers by sight
and the bells by sound; they were marks at sea as
well, and mariners knew them and their bells as
well as now they know bell-buoys and lighthouses
upon the charts. A hamlet with a church became
a "town," so a man says he's going to Church-town,
and still measures the distance between
places by saying it is so far from one church
tower to the other.</p>

<p>Then came the little chapel, four-square and
whitewashed, with plain glass windows, winking
and blinking in the daytime, but a place of joy.
Some people measure distances as from Bethel
to Zion, and then no other question is needed on
the point of worship. It's all there, when the
chapel comes before the church. The day of
bitterness is passing, but the preference comes
out accidentally.</p>

<p>Now there is a third building seen from far
and seen everywhere, and that is the school which
has been raised by the people with more hardship
and self-denial than in the rest of the kingdom,
because of the smallness of means, which often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
makes the dividing line with downright poverty
very fine indeed. Only the thrift of the people
would have enabled them to uprear schools finer
in every respect than chapels, and first and foremost
amongst the buildings of the county. The
schools rank next the churches, and are usually
built where they may be seen.</p>

<p>The parsons had to fight tooth and nail for
their tithes of cows and calves and pigs and other
things, and had to look sharp that butter and
cheese were not palmed off on them as of like
value. The Vicar of Zennor made a note in the
parish register that three of his tithe-paying
parishioners had planted butter and cheese in the
chancel of the church, where he let it stay until
it became too ripe for endurance, and then he
ordered the churchwardens to remove it, which
they did; and the three smart farmers lost their
produce, and the vicar got his tithe of living
animals, after all. A vicar wanted knowledge
not included in university curricula to make the
two ends meet in a Cornish parish in the good
old times. They have to struggle now to hold
their own and make a bit, which some say they
are doing, and some shake their heads, so one
may think what he likes.</p>

The</span> Cornish are born actors and
actresses, but the natural talent
is suppressed early, and it is not
considered respectable to do or
say anything like a "play-actor."
But the talent breaks bounds and
shows itself even in the last moments of the aged,
composing their features, so as to "look 'ansum"
after death.</p>

<p>The county has no theatre, no vaudeville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
nothing in which to develop the dramatic instincts
of a dramatic people. Now and again a travelling
company, or piece of one, gives a performance in
a hall licensed for dramatic presentations; but
the people have become shy of being seen with
uncovered faces at plays not labelled "sacred."
Susannah, with realistic touches, would be popular,
if the Lord Chamberlain could see his way to
license the performance. When away from home
the people patronize theatres and music-halls,
and, on their return, sing favourite hymns to
comic opera. Dancing is prohibited in places,
and is "taboo" even when winked at; but some
of the day schools are now teaching children how
to use their feet and legs to music, under the
head of "exercises" or "physical instruction."
When an Italian organ-grinder comes into a
village, the children dance as though they like
it. The Flora, or Flurry, dance has some claim
to be Cornish, and in time may be danced well
again in the open air at fairs and feasts.</p>

<p>The Cornish are imaginative, vivacious, quick
to realize situations. When there is any difficulty
about words, a man or woman will get over it by
acting the part. Watch the men disputing, and
you see unrehearsed comedy&mdash;and very good
comedy in its way. The old Cornish were very
fond of mysteries and miracle-plays, which were
performed in the open, and for the love of the
thing. If one may believe, tens of thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
people used to tramp over the pathless downs to
see a miracle-play, or a series of plays, performed
in some natural amphitheatre. The plays speak
for themselves. Some still exist, and we have
only to fancy the tens of thousands standing and
squatting around, gazing rapt and full-eyed upon
the stage hour after hour, and then day by day,
until the mysteries were finished for the season.
Men, women, and children all "trapsed" to these
plays, and, like the Japs of to-day, never left the
scene as long as there was anything to see. The
performances were realistic enough, and angels
and devils took their parts in a manner to upset
any respectable system of theology. The actors
learned their parts, and the prompter, book in
hand, followed the actors and told them what to
say when they were at a loss. The prompter
was known as the "ordinary," and on one
occasion the ordinary, being a pleasant conceited
gentleman, played "a merry prank" with a poor
actor who was not well up in his part. The
story runs: "His turn came: quoth the ordinary,
'Go forth, man, and show thyself.' The gentleman
steps out upon the stage, and, like a bad clerk
in Scripture matters, cleaving more to the letter
than the sense, pronounced those words aloud.
'Oh,' says the fellow softly in his ear, 'you
mar all the play.' And with this his passion the
actor makes the audience in like sort acquainted.
Hereon the prompter falls to flat railing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
cursing in the bitterest terms he could devise;
which the gentleman with a set gesture and
countenance still soberly related, until the
ordinary, driven at last into mad rage, was fain
to give all over; which trousse, though it break
off the interlude, yet defrauded not the beholders,
but dismissed them with a great deal more sport
and laughter than twenty such guaries could have
afforded."<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>In former times, Midsummer Eve festivities
were celebrated with much joyousness and dancing
through the streets, and the lighting of
bonfires at night, so that, seen from the sea, the
coast-line showed a blaze of light. This was
originally a pagan celebration of the summer
solstice, and the Romish Church took it over and
rechristened it, calling the rejoicing the festivals
of St. John and St. Peter. The Reformed Church
took over the festivals as a legacy, and they
lingered on in the land until dissent brought out
their fire brigades and at last extinguished them.
There is another "pagan" celebration which
will not die. The public May-time rejoicings
were nearly extinguished once, but are active
again, and the good people of Helston dress up,
and sing and dance from morn to night, because
the spring has come again, and the land may
once more be made beautiful with flower and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
corn. At one time the Church encouraged these
public rejoicings, and gave them as much of a
religious appearance as possible, but now there is
nothing to suggest religion except the "collection"
which the dancers make for their own benefit.</p>

<p>When the Cornish language fell into disuse,
fell also all prospect of a drama indigenous to a
land of which one can never say how much is
real. The sad autumn leaves fell upon the
literary remembrances of the people when old
Dolly Pentreath died, and as some one must
have been the last to speak the language, as well
Dolly as another, and better, perhaps, as we can
see her portrait and her monolith. The old
popular performances under the blue sky died
out with the tongue, and then followed the
travelling showman and the lady in tights and
spangles, and then the old Christmas mummers
with their diabolrie and three-men songs. The
English drama in no form has any hold in the
county now, and even Shakespeare is caviare to
the general. Only one Cornishman made his
mark upon the stage, and of no great credit he,
so we let him pass; but the county is foster-mother
to Sir Henry Irving, fittest of all men to
have been a son, so well he "loved the fancies
and legends of the people."<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>"There are comedies and tragedies with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
scenes laid in Cornwall in plenty, but no Cornish
drama or dramatist," said the Bookworm. And
yet there might have been.</p>

<p>Tregeagle is the Cornish Faust. The story
took a few centuries to develop, and there is
nothing to be added now to heighten its dramatic
effect. Tregeagle was a young man of ambition,
with a vein of discontent running through his
composition. One day, when brooding over what
he was, and what he would be, seeing all things
in false perspective, Old Artful made his acquaintance,
and there was the usual bargain, signed,
sealed and delivered. "This is my act and
deed," said Tregeagle, putting his finger on the
red seal drawn from his own veins. Tregeagle
was to live in airy-fairy palaces, and have the
run of every man's preserves until such time as
Old Artful choose, and then&mdash;well, what was
left of his tissue-paper soul would be wanted in
another place. Old Artful behaved in the handsomest
manner, and Mr. Tregeagle lived in a
palace in up-to-date splendour, with men-servants
and maid-servants, and every one took off his hat
or curtsied as he passed, and he was as hard to
the poor as a landlord's agent, and rode roughshod
over whom he would. In fact, he couldn't
be a greater swell before the days of motors. All
went gaily with him, until, one day, he consulted
his diary and found that his lease under the
contract had nearly expired, and then he became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
"hurried in his mind," and lost appetite, and cast
about to see if he could save himself, and pay no
forfeit. Now, Old Artful was a good judge of
character and knew his man, so, when the time
was up, he let the fairy palace, with all its
beautiful gardens and stables and greenhouses,
sink into the earth, and covered them over with
water so deep that some said no plummet could
find bottom. Having trapped his man so nicely,
Old Artful was in good humour, and gave Tregeagle
a limpet-shell with a hole in it, and told him
he might work out his redemption by emptying
the lake; for, said he, "you can't expect to have
all the good things of this world without paying
for them, either in money or marbles." Tregeagle
looked at the limpet-shell, so small that a thimbleful
of water would overflow it, and then at the
hole in the bottom, but he cared little for that as
he could stop it up with his finger. It was a
hopeless task, yet he was comforted by the
thought that in the matter of the hole, by stopping
it with his finger, he would score one off Old
Artful. Then he commenced baling the water
from the lake; and when he would rest, Old
Artful's imps spurred him on and on until he
shrieked and roared, so that all the people round
about him shook in their shoes. "To roar like
Tregeagle," became a saying when one was
groaning under deserved punishment. The unhappy
man is still working at his task, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
said there is not so much water in the lake as
aforetime.</p>

<p>"Then Old Artful will have outwitted himself
after all, for he gave the fellow a task intended
to be endless," said Guy.</p>

<p>"There is hope; and that is where the
Cornish story differs from many variations of
Faust," said the Bookworm.</p>

<p>"I like the Cornish all the better for that,"
said Guy.</p>

We</span> always removed our hats before
entering a church: it is the custom
of the country, and we were without
prejudices. If we saw a
clergyman wondering at the rapid
growth of nettles and docks and
wild heliotrope over his little freehold, we took
off our hats to him. I don't mention this in a
vain-glorious spirit, only once or twice we were
looked on with suspicion, and shown dirty finger-marks
upon walls, and scratches made with knives
upon monuments, and detestable rhymes scribbled
in pencil, where they could be seen. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
shown some writing which was discovered pinned
to the altar after a strange "gentleman and lady"
had made the round of the church, and gone
away. The verger apologized when showing us
the writing, which he did only in order to justify
his looking upon us with some degree of suspicion.
We felt sorry for the "lady and gentleman," and
they might have been sorry for themselves, if we
could have talked to them for a few minutes in a
convenient place.</p>

<p>The vicar came in and insisted on showing
us his "treasures." They were not many, and
we wished them more, for his sake, he was so
anxious to make us forget having been told that
a "gentleman" with a soft cap, and a "lady"
with no cap at all, should have been guilty of
pinning an indecent writing to God's altar. He
pitied them; and Guy felt that he would like to
have the chance of pitying the gentleman with
the soft cap after a strictly private interview.</p>

<p>The vicar tapped the Bookworm, and would
have us stay to luncheon. They exchanged
views, and talked book catalogues, and dry goods
like that. We got out into the grounds, which
were a little paradise. Something from all quarters
of the world grew there, and in the open, too&mdash;nothing
to hurt them, winter or summer, in this
charming place. We got away from books and
dry stuff at last, and found that our genial vicar
could talk other things.</p>

<p>"The <i>bien entente</i>, or <i>entente cordiale</i>, or whatever
you like to call it, which startled Europe, is
so old a thing amongst us, that we were set
laughing when told of the new discovery&mdash;the
diplomatic radium of the hour," said the vicar,
laughing.</p>

<p>"I thought you Cornish were very alarmed
at French invasions, and hated Frenchmen like
the lost archangel holy water. What were the
popular stories with which you sent children
sobbing to bed, about the Great Napoleon?"
asked the Bookworm.</p>

<p>"Stories innumerable, and they served a
purpose. A thousand such stories might be invented
to-morrow, and some would be believed,
with a German, a Russian, or a yellow bug-a-boo
for figurehead. But, let me tell you, there has
always been a link between England and France,
and that is the Cornu-Breton link. Cornish boats
were often safe in French harbours when Napoleon
was fitting out his great Armada, and Nelson
driving Frenchmen from the seas. We wanted
brandy and silks, and the French merchants
wanted money, so the <i>bien entente</i> was all serene.
Then we wanted salt for curing, and there was
nothing more common in our harbours than French
<i>chasse-marées</i> laden with sea-salt; and who more
popular than the Breton sailor in a Cornish port,
in blue blouse and sabots, and pockets stuffed full
of prunes, which he shook out as he walked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
followed by a queue of children singing, 'How
do you do, Johnny Crapaud?' And then, most
touching, when Frenchy and the little <i>mousse</i>, trusting
themselves alone in Cornish lanes, gathered
bucketfuls of esculent snails for soup. The <i>bien
entente</i> was all right still, though there were wars
and rumours of wars. The Cornu-Breton link
held fast when Cornwall raised its volunteers
when Napoleon the Third sent a thrill of fear
through the land, when Fashoda was a burning
word, and when the Paris journals made the
English blood boil during the Boer war. And
what was the Cornu-Breton link?"</p>

<p>The vicar paused, and then added: "The link
is here. It is knocking at my gate."</p>

<p>There was a chubby-faced youngster at the
back door, in blue smock and knitted cap, bending
under the weight of the onions he was carrying
suspended from a pole on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"This is the Cornu-Breton link&mdash;onions followed
salt, and salt brandy. These chubby-faced
boys invade us every year and 'dump' all the
spare onions they grow in their little gardens at
home. It is their harvest, and the brave little
hearts, trudging in a strange land, with raw
shoulders, are welcomed everywhere, whatever
the party passions of the hour. It is a small link,
but it is steel, and when London and Paris were
drinking champagne to the new sensation, we
were buying our onions off our little Breton friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
giving them milk to drink, and sharing pasties,
and giving them ointments with which to rub
their poor little raw shoulders, and then resting
them in barns so that they might be up and off
with sunrise to sell their onions."</p>

<p>The vicar beckoned to the boy, who came
and told us of his home at Paimpol; this was his
second season here, and next year he would not
come because he was conscript, and would serve
on board a man-of-war. His eyes glistened when
he talked of meeting British ships, and the Cornish
bluejackets who knew him as a little onion boy.
And they would be friends!</p>

<p>Guy tipped the boy when no one was looking,
and so did his best to keep the Cornu-Breton link
intact.</p>

<p>I do believe the good vicar was sorry when
we went.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The people are not given to "hustle;" if the
word has reached the county, the thing hasn't in
any great quantity. There is still a blessed refuge
in the world for men and women tired of "hustle"
in all its moods and tenses. Being on time at a
railway station is genuine distress to natives until
they get used to it, and the language is not strong
in equivalents for "hustle." To make moderate
haste is to "hurry-all," to be in a genuine hurry
is to be "stark-staring-mad." The idea of smoothness
resulting from leisure suits the Cornish genius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
at home, and he has a pleasing word for it in
"suant." When everything is as "suant as oil,"
it is perfection itself. "Who carries the broth
must go suant," gives the idea of abundance of
time in which to perform an errand without mishap.
To be too slow for anything is only to be
"asleep"&mdash;there is no anger in the reproach, just
a gentle reminder, that is all. Anything mouldy
and vinewed is said to be "sleeping"&mdash;in a
delicious state of rest which it would be a pity
to disturb. A Cornishman only does one job at
a time; when he talks he rests from all other
work.</p>

<p>Guy said he must have his hair cut; the Bookworm
might please himself; it might suit his style
of beauty to be mistaken for an ancient bard.
The first town we came to we looked out for the
striped pole, and there was one outside a tobacco
shop. It was afternoon when we entered the
shop with a partition running through it, so one
half was sacred to the "weed," and the other half
to the performance of ancient rites. A green
curtain divided the double shop from the rear.
The shop was empty, but the curtain was half
drawn, and we saw a man polishing his boots.
This was the barber, who finished his job, and
met us, smiling. Guy induced the Bookworm to
take the chair first, because his hair being darker
would not show the illustrative finger-marks so
clearly as his own. Guy talked to the barber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
about boot-polish, and so interested him that he
stopped operations and talked. A man came in
and propped up the partition with a shoulder, and
Mr. Figaro left his job and served a packet of
cigarettes. Then the new-comer began a story
about one Billy Tregarne who, falling down a
clay-pit, was mistaken for the miller by his own
wife, who turned him to doors with much abuse
and a "scat in the chacks." It was all very
interesting, but took time, and the Bookworm
was only half trimmed. The new-comer suddenly
remembered that he had left his shop open with
no one to "mind" it, and walked away as leisurely
as he came. Then Mr. Figaro worked away,
only stopping occasionally to enjoy an inward
chuckle; and when Guy went off without being
operated on, he seemed quite glad at having no
more to do just then.</p>

<p>In towns, tradesmen spend a good deal of
time in their shop doors, looking "up-along" and
"down-along," or across the street, and hold conversations
with each other in their several shop
doors.</p>

<p>The inhabitants live long and die leisurely.
When one is a trifle over-anxious people tell him
not to worry, for "you'll live till you die, like
Nicketty Booth."</p>

<p>The man in the highway never misses a
chance for a gossip, and will give old nuts for
news, to any extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Holloa! my man; which is the way to
Church-town?" Guy shouted to a labourer, who
seemed to be doing his best to prop up a hedge.</p>

<p>The man struck work at once and came
forward leisurely. He eyed us up and down,
making a mental register of our marks. Then
he seemed to take an interest in us and our
business.</p>

<p>"Going Church-town, art a?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and which is the way?"</p>

<p>"Want to see Farmer? Well, then, a ed'n
home. Farmer had fine field of wheat in ten-acre
field, sure 'nuff, and he's gone to market.
He was drashing yesterday, and the drashing
machine cut off Tom Curnow's fingers. Ess
sure, 'e ded."</p>

<p>"We don't want Farmer," said Guy, cutting in.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Tom Trebilcock? Tom's cow
calved last week, and she's a good milker. Didn't
know Tom was going to sell."</p>

<p>"Never mind Tom; tell us the road, the way,
the what-you-like-to-call-it, to Church-town."</p>

<p>"There's passun's house close by the church,
and passun's little mare is a good un to travel.
They do say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do we get there?"</p>

<p>"Ef so be you'm in a hurry you need'n go,
cos Farmer's drivin' mare to market."</p>

<p>"We'd like to get there in daylight," said
Guy, gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sartinly;" and then the man gathered himself
together for a supreme effort. "You do go
through meadow-close, and plain-close, and then
into high-lane, and volly on, an' there you be,
sure."</p>

<p>"But where is meadow-close?"</p>

<p>"Oh, back along."</p>

<p>"But where?"</p>

<p>"Back along to stile."</p>

<p>"Thanks very much, my good man, and may
your shadow never grow less."</p>

<p>We left the man apparently wondering what
sort of animals there were at large who didn't
know the way to Church-town. Gradually he
unbent himself, and went back to prop up the
hedge.</p>

<p>In conversation a good deal of ground is
covered in a non-committal sort of way by illustrations
well understood by the parties, but
Greek to any stranger. A worthy person who
does mischief with the best intentions is said to
be like "Aunt Gracie's vear"&mdash;which means that
the little pig, with the best intentions in the
world, sucked the old sow to death. Few would
suspect that "Betsy Bowden's leg" tells a tragedy,
but it does:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Old age and sorrows did she decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her bad leg carried she away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To have "Betsy Bowden's leg" is a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
serious matter to those who understand what it
means.</p>

<p>"It's as well to leave high English at home,"
said the local doctor, whom Guy picked up in his
rambles. "I was asked by a woman on leaving
the house of a patient the other day what the
matter was? and, in a moment of forgetfulness,
I said it was a case of 'strangulated hernia.' 'My
dear life!' said the woman, opening her eyes
wide, 'that's a very different story to what I
heard.' 'And what did you hear?' 'Why, I
heard that the man had a kink in his innards.'
We meant the same thing; but you must live
amongst people really to understand and be
understood."</p>

<p>Sometimes a humorous situation is created,
and the incident lives. An officer inspecting
volunteers wished to dismiss them. "Stand at
ease! Attention! Disperse!" The men stood
still with wonder in their eyes. "Disperse!"
repeated the officer, and still the men stood still.
The sergeant saluted. "May I give the order?"
"Certainly." Then the sergeant: "Stand at
ease! Attention! Scat up!" And every man
went his way, and the corps are the "Scat-ups"
to this day.</p>

<p>A coastguard told us the story of a young
officer of the kid-glove type giving an order to the
men in the maintop. "Maintop, ahoy!" "Aye,
aye, sir." "Extinguish the illuminator." "No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
such rope, sir." Then the boatswain: "Maintop,
ahoy!" "Aye, aye, sir." "Douse the glim."
Light goes out.</p>

<p>A bargain is dear to the soul of a Cornishman;
only send round the crier with the bell,
announcing a sale, and he'll be there, and pay
cheerfully more than the things are worth, if only
he's told that he's getting a bargain. To get
something for next to nothing is to be happy.
A man will walk two miles to ride one, and build
his house out of shape rather than remove a bit
of rock which can be worked into the wall.
Much ingenuity is shown in using up odds and
ends of things. A sailor will tell you that any
man can make a sail if he has plenty of canvas
to cut from, but the man for his money is the
man who "makes do what won't do." To throw
anything on the scrap-heap as long as there's wear
or use in it, would make an average man turn
green, and wish for the better land. He's thrifty
in the wrong place, and can't help it; but once
get him away from home and he develops and
does well, as times go. We were told that
Bryant, of blacking and match fame, and Pears,
of soap fame, are not only Cornish, but hail from
neighbouring parishes; and Ralph Allen, the
lucky, was born at St. Blazey. Ralph was a man
of many parts. He brought some order and
method into our country mail services, ran the
Bath theatre, married a beautiful wife, and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
£16,000 a year out of a Government contract.
Once outside the charmed circle of his native
land, a Cornishman gets on just as well as a
Scotchman, and is as thrifty as need be.</p>

<p>There is an ingrained dislike amongst the
Cornish towards mean-looking things, and things
ugly or deformed. A well set-up man, with head
thrown back defiantly, and arms swinging, is forgiven
much on account of his appearance of
strength and general can-take-care-of-myselfness.
A weak-looking man with a mean face must walk
warily if he's to get credit at all for the good that
is actually in him. An elegant woman, well-dressed,
is immaculate; and a woman with an
eye generous and passionate has her sins condoned
almost before they are committed. But
let a woman squint and be anæmic, short in nose,
and long in chin, a bit "hunchy" and out of
shape, and goodness becomes an added offence
to her sin of living. "A poor, wakely thing,"
and "a wisht, old-fashioned maid," are offences
to the community, and are willingly parted with.
Downright ugliness in man or woman is looked
on as the devil's hall-mark;&mdash;"mark you the man
whom nature marks," is a proverb. The first
question asked about a stranger is, what does he,
or she, look like? A great deal depends on the
answer&mdash;a good-looking and fair-spoken person
may travel far and suffer no hunger in the land.
The devil is sin, and sin the father of ugliness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
hence an ugly person has the devil for father,
and is treated accordingly.</p>

<p>The Cornish are a very hopeful race. Bad
times depress, but there is always to-morrow to
look forward to, and to-morrow may be better
than to-day. Without this bank of hope to draw
upon, the two main industries of the county,
mining and fishing, would have caved in long,
long ago. Contentment is another sign by which
you may know the Cornishman at home. If a
man meets with misfortune, or a friend has gone
under, he sums it all up by saying, "Well, there
'tis." The phrase "there 'tis," is like a plaister
of figs covering a sore, hiding much, but giving
rise to hope that a healing process may be
going on.</p>

<p>"How be gettin' on, Jim, without the ould
woman?" asks a man of his fellow who has
buried his wife. "Slight, sure 'nuff, at first, but
there 'tis;" and then he goes on about his work,
as though the last word was said upon the matter.
Equally content is another aged pilgrim who has
lost the partner of his joys. "Do 'ee miss her,
Bill?" "Ess, sure." "Lonely, s'poase?" "Ess,
tes lonely, but tes quiet." Bill was content.
"When the cyder is rinned away every drap, 'tis
too late to be thinkene of plugging the tap," is
a little bit of old proverbial philosophy which
escaped Martin Tupper. The same spirit is in
the words, "Well, there 'tis," whether the cyder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
cask runs dry, or a mine is "knocked," or a ship
is wrecked, or a pitcher is broken. "Well, there
'tis," says the victim, with the beautiful serenity
of fatalism. "There 'tis," and hope springs up
amongst the ruins of shattered hopes, and the
Cornishman goes on his way again, trundling his
own wheelbarrow, without appealing to the
heavens and the earth and all that therein is to
listen to his misfortunes. When he has a stroke
of good luck he's very quiet about it.</p>

<p>"I knaw he 'ave a chate somebody, he's so
quiet," one man will say of another on a market
day.</p>

Tickle</span> a Cornishman, and he'll
smile. He likes it; and when
you have rested, begin again,
and he'll still smile. Some people
want different handling, like
Kaffirs in mines, who only smile
nicely after being knocked down with a crowbar.
"Going! And I'm just beginning to like 'ee," is
a common form of regret towards a civil-tongued
stranger who has found out the way to tickle.
Cornishmen abroad tickle one another at their
annual dinners, when all that's fair and lovely to
the sight "belongs" to the land of pasties and
cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>There are some dialects which make people
restless, and some which make people tearful,
and some to want to go to theatres and operas,
and some to churches, and some&mdash;well, elsewhere.
An Irish M.P., on the wrongs of Ireland, is sure
to make you tearful; and a Scotchman, mellow,
is certain to cry himself when eloquent on Bobby
Burns; but the ordinary Englishman is not
moved to tears by ordinary English. His language
is very good for getting about with in
trains and tramcars, and finding out the prices of
things, and making profits from the Equator to
the Pole. A hard-hearted sort of a language,
that wants filing and sand-papering a bit to reach
the heart&mdash;like French, just by way of making
a comparison, which will not be odious now the
<i>bien entente</i> is on the carpet.</p>

<p>One should come into the duchy to hear how
the English language may acquire a languorous
ease, which makes one want to sit still at the
first milestone, and never to go any further. At
first, Guy wanted everything "sharp"&mdash;boots
"sharp," breakfast "sharp," everything to the
minute, and every one on the alert. The Cornish
constitution wasn't made to work that way in
Cornish air. A woman was selling fruit at a
street corner, and Guy bought some. A small
boy was sent to change a coin, and Guy grew
tired and impatient of waiting. Then he murmured,
and talked of calling again at Christmas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
if the boy was likely to be back by then. The
woman was sweetly placid, and asked Guy if he
was in a hurry? Guy said he wasn't suffering
from that complaint, only he liked to see boys
smart, and things done quickly, and so help the
world to spin.</p>

<p>"I hate to be kept waiting," said he.</p>

<p>"It doan't sim long to we," said the woman,
counting the coppers slowly, one by one, into
Guy's impatient palm, when the boy did return.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem long to the native to "quat,"
and listen to another telling a yarn of endless
length which might all be packed into a sixpenny
"wire." The stranger has to get rid of irritable
impatience before the restful influences of the
words, and the manner of speaking them, lay hold
of him; and when they do he is in a peaceful
oasis. A bustling commercial man never dreams
of opening his samples until he's inquired about
all the family, down to the third generation; and
in villages he has to remember that his customer's
cow was bad last journey, that his black minorca
hen hatched out fifteen eggs, and that the rats
carried away ten in a single night. Then he has
to see the missus, and talk babies, and corns, and
indigestion; and then, when no one is looking,
he undoes his samples, and business is introduced
as though by accident.</p>

<p>Who can be in a hurry when he finds that to
get to a place three or four miles away he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
take the road to Trevalsamin, then cross the
town place at Ponsandain, which brings you to
the stile at Hallywiden, leave Ventongimps to
the right, and the church-town of Trevespanvean
will come in view, then down by Trebarva well,
and you will reach your destination? Imagine
this direction given in a zigzag fashion, with
comments and sketches of scenery thrown in, and
the story of a man who tackled a bull down by
Trannack-Treneer bottom, and was carried home
on a gate, and then lived&mdash;&mdash;. You can't get
away from the man until a sense of peace has
fallen upon you; and you don't care if you take
the journey now, or put it off until to-morrow.</p>

<p>The old people who invented these names
were in no humour for hurry, and names are as
thick as blackberries, for every field, and brake,
and bottom has its own particular name, which
is always repeated in full in conversation, no odds
how often it occurs. A farmer knows his fields
by their names, just as he knows his children by
theirs. The English language shows its restful
side in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Since our first parents were turned out of
Eden, there has been no paradise for children
more perfect than Cornwall. We didn't know it
until we were told so by an old man hobbling
along by the side of a donkey with panniers on
its back, and in the panniers fresh fish to sell in
the villages through which we were to pass. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
old man was in trouble on account of the school
children jumping on his donkey's back, and
riding off at their own sweet wills. Then a boat
came in with a little "cate" of fish, which the
old man bought to sell to country, but nowhere
could the donkey be found. Then he went
about seeking, until, at last, he ran the animal to
earth in a quarry in a brake, where the children
had hidden it in order to ride back again in
triumph after school. This was the old man's
grievance, and he called heaven and earth to
witness that there was no place under the sun
where the rising generation better deserved
hanging than in this parish; or where parents
more deserved hanging for bringing up such
varmints.</p>

<p>Guy tried his hand at a little friendly examination,
and we learnt that things were different
when the old man was young; when his very
own father would have thought no more of cutting
him down with a shovel, or stretching him stiff
with a hammer, if he went leastways contrary,
than he would have of eating a pasty. Well, if he
did not like it he had to put up with it, like the
rest, and it taught him how children ought to be
trained. But now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The old man was too full of words to speak
for a time, but a passage cleared itself, and then
we found it was all the fault of the school, and
the rates, that children were varmints, and ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to be nailed up to barn doors, like weasels and
wants, and sich-like. "Lay a finger upon a cheeld
now, and the wimmen'll screech murder, marbleu!
just as ef the French was coming. An' th' men's
no better, tes oal, 'Coom here, Johnny, my son,
an' plaise doan'ee break th' cloam, an' plaise
doan'ee make a malkin ov yersel'; an' plaise
doan'ee stale Tom Cobbledick's jackass, and
hide'n away, when he do waant to go to country
weth vish.' I'd 'plaise' em, th' varmints; I'd
scat th' brains ov'm out!"</p>

<p>The old man told us frankly that the maidens
were a tarnation sight worse than the boys under
the new order of things. They didn't steal
away his donkey, but they were the cause of
quarrels among the women, and the women egged
on the men, until there was neither rest nor
peace in the parish. "There's that maid of
Nancy Golley's," said he, "an' you'd s'poase she
was the quietest maid in the country to see her
on a Sunday, with a feather in her hat a yard long,
and oal the fashions on her back. An' so she es
quiet till she do see another maid come down
along weth something on her back which she
thinks would suit her beauty better. Then what
do she do but go over to the other maid, oal
artful-like, an' begin to purr round, and find out
what it cost, and what tallyman her mother got
it from; and then she rounds and says, ted'n paid
for, and she ought to be ashamed to wear it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
when her old granny is eating parish bread.
Then the two wimmen begin upon their own
account, and rip up each other, an' set th' men
on; and they'd have killed one t'other, only the
parish com'd in and tooked sides, and fout till
they cud'n blaw nor strike. And this trubble oal
becase the maidens were dressed up, and sent
to school to learn bukes, instead of goin' to work.
I'd giv' it to th' varmints, ess, sure I wud," said
he, with a sing-song drawl, but all his ill-temper
gone.</p>

<p>The old man turned down a by-lane to sell a
fish at a farmhouse, first telling us how to find
Church-town and Mrs. Tregarthen's inn, where
there was "a drap of good beer" on tap, and
we could pay for a pint for him to drink when
he came along.</p>

<p>Guy said it was refreshing to hear higher
criticism of this sort; and wondered what the
Education Department would think did they but
know what a man of the soil thought of their
strenuous efforts to spoil the rod and teach the
"varmints" to have it their own way? The
Bookworm wouldn't be provoked into saying
anything, and so we reached the inn, and found a
very good larder there.</p>

<p>There was a pleasant hum of talk outside the
inn, where a knot of young miners were chatting
over what concerned them most. The corner of
the building seemed to be the favourite spot in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the whole village, and the young men took turns
to scratch themselves between the shoulders
against the corner-stones. It soothed them, and
when they'd all scratched in turns, they did a sort
of jig with heel and toe, kicking the wall with the
heels of their boots. They never came inside;
and this was their way of showing that they had
no animosity to the institutions of their country.
Our window was open, and Guy said this would
be a good opportunity for studying the language
of the district. "When people are together they
talk it pure," said he, arousing the Bookworm's
attention.</p>

<p>Picking up a dialect in this way is not so easy;
everybody seems talking at once, and there's no
full-stops, and the commas, when there are any,
seem to be in the wrong places. After a time,
we captured a few syllables, and the Bookworm
wrote down phonetically a conversation with two
voices only&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say-yu, whatkoorarta?"</p>

<p>"Laastkoor b'nite."</p>

<p>"Adurnedkoorthat."</p>

<p>We all heard it, and there was no doubt about
the sounds; every shorthand writer would be sure
on that point. Then we called in Mrs. Tregarthen's
husband and read over the transcript, and
he said it was all right, and we might take away
as much of the dialect as we pleased in the same
way. He spoke slowly, and it came out like this&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say you, what coor art thou?"</p>

<p>"Last coor by night."</p>

<p>"A durned coor that."</p>

<p>A "coor" is a turn, or shift, in mine work, and
the last shift by night is not popular. Guy asked
the Bookworm how long he thought it would take
him to pick up the dialect? and suggested leaving
him behind, and calling for him later. The Bookworm
was used to this sort of thing from Guy.</p>

<p>We picked up a dialect story, and preserved a
sentence or two, warranted to be genuine.</p>

<p>"Giv' me a kiss, me aul' dear," said Phil
Pentreath, fisherman, just home from a cruise,
throwing his arms around his wife, who has got
herself up for the occasion, and does not want to
be rumpled. She flushes, and is in a great rage,
but can't get over the ground quicker than this&mdash;</p>

<p>"Taake yer baastlie wristeses awah fr'm me
neck, you stinken', ravishen' aythen! Lemmego!
I waan't kiss'ee, and you oall auver sunken' grease-oil
an' tar. My sawl an' bawdee! I shud be fitty
parfit ashaamed, ef I was you, kissen' your wife in
broad daalight, an' daown-steers, too." An East
End girl would cut half across London in the
time.</p>

<p>Cornish maids don't like cool lovers, and you
may kiss early and often, and be thought none
the worse of by the maid you are sweet on. If
nothing comes of it the kissing part will be all
right, and can be wiped out, or carried forward, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
pleasure. Kissing is a mode of salutation in some
districts where the population is stationary and all
the families somehow connected, and a strange
kiss is welcome as varying the flavour. It is a
sign of religious communion among the Methodists&mdash;the
old people enjoy it at their love-feasts, and
the young take kindly to the godly example.
There is no such county on earth for "kiss-in-the-ring"
at teas and picnics&mdash;old and young, rich and
poor, pastors and flock, run after one another,
chasing and doubling and tumbling, and then
"smack, smack," and the captives are led back
with eyes sparkling and lips watering for more
runs and more kisses. Pious elders see their
young ministers dashing after the maidens, lifting
up their chins, and kissing them on the lips, and
holding them in tight embrace the while, and they
just nod to one another and smile, as who should
say, "Bless the dear lambs, lev 'em enjoy themselves
while they'm young." But only say
"dance," and the dear old faces are troubled with
visions of the "pit" yawning beneath their feet.
There are different ways of kissing in different
parishes, so a young man may tell in the dark
what parish a girl comes from by the way she
acts, if only he has had sufficient practice. It all
comes to the same thing, though the maidens
think themselves slighted if not kissed often
enough. As a rule they get on very well.</p>

<p>The common furze which blooms perpetually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
has, on that account, got mixed up with kissing;
and when a girl is asked, "When is kissing out of
season?" her ready answer is, "When the furze
is out of bloom;" that is to say, never. The rich
chrome yellow is very seductive, but the thorns!</p>

<p>In the south, when a maid is disappointed in
love she takes to her bed, and is waited upon by the
rest of the family, just as though she were passing
through a sickness known to the pharmacopæia.
It is a matter of public interest; and the maid
is said to be "wisht" about it, and going into
a "decline." Generally, it comes all right again,
and the maid gets up and walks out with her
young man, and receives the congratulations of
the parish. Then things are hurried up, and the
end comes.</p>

The</span> girls learn early that "it is not
good for man to live alone," and
never forget it. It is the one
text that sticks, and they make
the running early for the boys,
who are a shy and awkward lot,
and want encouragement at first. Then the boys
wake up, and the girls catch them, as they intended
to do when they first started; and the
boys grow into men, and are never "alone" any
more. Marriages may be made in heaven for
other folks, but the Cornish maidens like them
better on earth, and please themselves pretty
much in the matter. Misfits will happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
sometimes, but they have a nice, soft, easy way
of their own, and slip through life "as well as
moast, and better'n some."</p>

<p>The women make very good wives, and seldom
become acquainted with the learned president of
the Divorce Court; and if they don't believe the
men are "saints," they wink the other eye and
say little. A country-woman, tired of her bargain,
inquired of a solicitor where she could get a bottle
of the "drops" for the dissolution of her marriage,
apparently thinking that nothing weaker than legal
aquafortis, or Dutch drops, would be any good to
dissolve the bond. Very few Cornish women have
figured in the Divorce Court, which stands to
their credit, so many being the wives of sailors
at sea nine months out of the year, or of miners
in foreign lands, whom they may not see for years
after a brief honeymoon. In the Cornish version
of the old mystery play of the Deluge, willing
obedience to the husband is shown in the dialogue
between Noah and his spouse. Noah says it is
time to get into the ark, and the lady says, "Oh,
master dear! I will do everything like as thou
wishest." In the Chester play on the same subject
the wife of Noah is a perverse, wilful, passionate
woman, who will not go into the ark
unless every one of her "gossipes" go with her.
And when her sons get her in by superior force,
she gives poor Noah a slap in the face, saying,
"Have that for thy note!" The unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Cornish translator changed the note to suit his
audience. A married woman makes the best of
her bargain, and finds "Oh, master dear!" better
than fisticuffs.</p>

</p></div>

<p>The women take a pride in doing little things
for their husbands&mdash;polishing their Sunday boots,
brushing and putting away their clothes, and
turning them out spick-and-span, like dandies.
A man isn't allowed to look after anything but
his sea-boots and oileys, if he's a fisher; or his
working togs, if some other trade. When there
are girls in a family the boys are "tended" like
little princes; and when the girls marry they look
after their husbands so carefully that they seldom
stray far away. Ladies who write social conundrums
to the newspapers, and ask how it is that
they only get a bit of their husbands, and that
bit not worth the having, should live in a Cornish
village for a season, and keep their eyes open.
Not very exciting, to be sure, but, if all is true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
worth the experiment. The beautiful influence
of climate comes in, "and so it is; and you must
put up with it, my dear," is the grease-box which
makes the wheels run smoothly.</p>

<p>The women keep shop in the small towns
and villages whilst the men go to sea, or fishing,
or whatever work they profess to do. A bell
tinkles when you open the door, and, by-and-by,
the missus comes into view, wiping her hands on
her apron. She may have what's wanted, but
generally she's "run out," and is expecting it
within a week or so. She goes on wiping her
hands, and looks as contented as though she had
sold something. Then the little shops look like
a dry-goods store after an earthquake, and if the
thing wanted isn't on top it is not much good
looking for it.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> It's just their way, and the
business flourishes like a plant in native soil.
Sometimes the post-office is mixed up with the
"business," and a dear little cherub sits up aloft
somewhere and watches over the property of the
Postmaster-General. Letters and parcels muddle
through, somehow, which is proof positive that
the age of miracles is not over and done with.</p>

<p>For the spectator a wedding is a very dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and slow affair now, even in out-of-the-way districts
and in the fishing coves and villages, where
the old customs have struggled hard to live.
Young people are married all the same, but
much of the joy at the life that is to be has been
gradually elbowed out of the ceremony, and all
that belongs to it. It used to be a very different
sort of thing when the people were more prone
to dancing and fiddling and feasting, and only
half enjoyed a thing unless all their world enjoyed
with them. The Bookworm chanced on some
faded letters describing some of the merry-makings
not more than a century ago, when a wedding
was an event, not for John and Mary merely, but
for the whole parish. The fiddler skipped before
the happy pair to church, and every one, not in
the procession with wedding favours, lined up,
and made nice little speeches, as the spirit moved
them; and the spirit moved them so often that
the bride had few blushes to spare when she
reached the chancel steps. And then the feast
and dance and mystic rites, concluding with the
bedding of the bride. Then more dancing for
the guests; and more young couples vowed that
day to marry within the year than on any other
occasion. It was a "quiet" wedding which
finished up with a three days' rejoicing.</p>

<p>If John and Mary lived on a farm, or were
servants at the "big house," then there were high
jinks in the great kitchen and squire's hall, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
no one merrier than parson and clerk, who led
the revels with voice and flute, and the schoolmaster
brought his fiddle, if he had one. A
wedding was a very human affair, and everybody's
business, not so very long ago. In the fishing
villages there was more colour and boisterous
mirth than elsewhere, for the men dressed their
boats, and made sport, and sang and danced, and
got drunk and sober, and then drunk again, until
the morn broke. And the next day, and the
next to that, the pot was kept a-boiling, and then
the women captured their men and toddled them
home, and hid away their boots, until the delirium
of the wedding march had passed away.</p>

<p>No more feasting and fiddling now. The
"day" is kept secret, and the "happy pair"
arrive, somehow, before a registrar, and are
hitched up, according to law. Mary may marry
John now, and no one be the wiser&mdash;a cold,
cheerless, colourless thing is this sort of wedding.</p>

<p>A funeral is still an event, and touches hidden
springs, which must gush forth, and will take no
denial. The people have a superstitious reverence
for the dead. The doors and windows of
the chamber are thrown open for the unfettered
spirit to escape, and, one by one, neighbours and
friends take a last look at familiar features. To
be "a 'ansum corpse, white as a lily and light as
cobwebs," is a consolation to an old rip, when
looking at his wasted hands. A village funeral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
is a long procession with sacred hymns. Then a
cup of tay and a bit of curranty cake amongst
the women, who talk and sigh, and tell each
other of their own complaints, and the complaints
which carried off their friends. Widow-women
are great at funerals, which freshen up their
memories. "My man was teeled a year agone,
an' I do miss 'un," says number one. "Ess, fath,
my dear, and no wan do knaw what tes like them
that's lonely," says number two. "Tes bitter
cauld in winter, an' I tells my maid her poor
father would be weth me now ef 'twadn't for want
of bref. Tes a wisht complaint, that," continues
number one, sighing. "'Twadn't like that weth
my man, fur he had es bref up to the last," replies
number two, triumphantly vindicating the superior
merits of her dear departed.</p>

<p>Widow-women don't often change their names.
If without money they are not tempted; and if
they have enough they may tempt, but seldom
yield. The next-of-kin are very watchful over
the shekels; and the man who marries a widow
with relations does not always enter paradise.
A widow-woman is looked on in the light of an
investment. Here is a short story. Mrs. Treloar
was a widow-woman with a bit of property&mdash;just
comfortable, as times go. She was no great
beauty, but the chapel steward cast a longing eye
towards her, and wished to lose no time. Said
he: "We doan't want to go coorting, do us?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Waste of precious time for us who are both old
enuf to know our own minds." Said she: "You
knaw, s'poase, ef I do marry agen, boy Tom'll have
the property?" Then he: "Why, es that so?
Then you won't sell at that price, I'm thinkin'.
Good day, my dear." No harm done.</p>

<p>Guy made the observation that the people
we saw about were not much given to frills. He
supposed they had them packed up somewhere,
but there being no swagger concerts, and bands
on swagger piers, with swagger subscription
tickets for the season, no one unpacked them.
It would be too absurd to go about freshly
dollied up, three times daily, to show one's self to
sea-cliffs, and sea-sands, moss-grown monoliths,
and British tumuli, and all that sort of thing.
The piskies would laugh. The Bookworm remembered
a French professor writing that when
he visited the Acropolis at Athens he removed
his rings and watchchain as being too much out
of keeping with his surroundings. He said he
smiled at the confession at the time as "too
Frenchy," but it had a new meaning for him
here. Wherever we went no one we met seemed
to want to show off their "frills" to one another,
or to the hoary fragments of antiquity permitted
to survive&mdash;one would just as soon think of
dressing up and showing off in a museum of
extinct animals. It must take a lot off a woman's
brain, Guy said, to know that she need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
unpack her things; and he supposed that was one
reason why so many took their fresh air and
sunshine treatment now on Cornish moors and
beaches, instead of crowding stuffy old German
spas, where it was the rule to put in time in
showing new "frills" to one another.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the people inhabiting highways,
byways, and villages as to the going and
coming of strangers has been so gratified of late,
that little short of a dancing bear would cause a
woman to run to her door, and stare wide-eyed
and open-mouthed. The advent of the hatless
one in many colours, making the sun to blush, or
in oilskins in wet weather, seemingly satisfied the
native, and made every other vagary, hats or no
hats, clothes or none, not only possible, but
something to be looked for amongst strangers.
A tall, thin lady, showing much wrist and leg,
swinging a stick, and wearing her hair short,
passed along the road, taking it easy at five
miles an hour. She was a new arrival at a
whitewashed house with thatched roof at the end
of the village. We were chatting to an old
woman in a big blue sunbonnet (called a "gook"),
who had rested her basket on the top step of the
market cross.</p>

<p>"Stranger?" asked Guy.</p>

<p>"Iss, sure; we doan't grow that soart in this
soil, but they may wan day, for I do mind when
they ded'n grow mangel-wuzzels. What do I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
caal 'em? Why, I do caal 'em great he-shees&mdash;they'm
spoiled fur women, and bain't vitty fur
men."</p>

<p>This was a wayside verdict on a choice variety
of the sort.</p>

side with a tang. "To

for Parliamentary honours once
sent the freemen of the borough
a silver teapot, as a prize to be sailed for at

A Cornishman likes a story about some one who
comes out on top by a trick; or one which hides
his meaning by a play of words, until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
situation is revealed in a flash. We picked up a
few specimens.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">As Deep as Old Hugh.</span></p>

<p>Two brothers went a-fishing, and one was a
scholar, with a reputation beyond his attainments,
which, in fact, were limited to reading and
writing, after a fashion, and reckoning with his
head. The other was a man of simple and
trustful nature, and was often puzzled, but let
things go without inquiring deeply into them.
The scholar was called Hugh, and as he managed
to come out on top on most occasions, he was
considered both cunning and wise, and people
encouraged their children to cram themselves
with book-learning in order to become "as deep
as old Hugh;" and "deep as old Hugh" became
a proverb which he locally shared with old Nick,
who, up to this time, had the monopoly. The
simple brother was Dick. Hugh and Dick were
partners in a small boat and nets, and earned a
poor living by their trammels, and drag-nets, and
crab-pots. What they caught they equally
divided, but Hugh always had the best half,
which puzzled Dick; but scratch his head as he
might, he could never get to the bottom of the
mystery, everything being so fair and aboveboard,
and done in the light of day. One day
they were out and caught six mackerel and six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
scads. Now, scads are of small value, and yet
Dick got them all, and Hugh all the mackerel.
Hugh did the sharing: "Here's a mackerel for
me, and a scad for you," said he, making a
division; "and a scad for you, and a mackerel
for me; and a mackerel for me and a scad for
you," and so on, until <i>all</i> the scads fell to Dick,
and <i>all</i> the mackerel to himself. Hugh's system
was perfect, and, if it could be adapted, might be
depended on to break the bank of Monte Carlo
every night. "How is it that I've got all the
scads?" asked Dick. "It's all right," replied
Hugh, pleasantly. "And if you don't think so,
I'll do it over again&mdash;here's a mackerel for me
and a scad for you, and a scad for you and a
mackerel for me," and so on to the end, until Dick
got <i>all</i> the scads as before.</p>

<p>"He would have settled the fiscal question
in no time," said Guy. "'A mackerel for me and
a scad for you'&mdash;a fair motto for protectionists."
The game was played in the Far East with the
Mikado, but the Czar got the scads. It's safest
played with the blind.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Man who slept with a Badger.</span></p>

<p>Guy wanted something done to a shoe, and
walked into a room where a man was sitting,
waxing a long thread, and whistling to the
thrushes and blackbirds hung around in cages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
The fellow was most obliging, Guy told us, and
put aside the work he was doing, and asked
several questions about himself&mdash;where he came
from; where he was going; how long he intended
to stay; and whether his father and mother were
living? Then the cobbler told him about himself,
and how many of the Tremains&mdash;he being
called Reuben Tremain&mdash;lay in the parish churchyard.
All this time Guy's shoe rested on his
apron. Just a few stitches were all that was
wanted, and Mr. Tremain got in one when he
started talking of London, what a "braave plaace"
it must be, and what a "pure few" people it contained,
all being true that he had heard. Guy
forgot about his shoe, and gave an entertaining
sketch of a London crowd in Fleet Street on
Lord Mayor's Day, and the Lord Mayor's show
was described in his best style. And then the
Crystal Palace on a fête day, and on a Handel
Festival day, and the Houses of Parliament, and
Madame Tussaud's! Guy made the Arabian
Nights' Entertainments look small, and he began
to fear that Reuben Tremain would be paralyzed
with admiration, and unable to put in another
stitch. All the morning was gone, and Guy still
sat on a low three-legged stool, with one shoe off,
as happy as any Lord Chancellor on the Woolsack.
He really was enjoying himself with the
simple Reuben.</p>

<p>"Ded 'ee ever hear tell ov a man up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Lunnon who slept with a badger?" asked the
cobbler, at length piercing the shoe with his awl
for another stitch.</p>

<p>"A real, live badger?"</p>

<p>"Ess, sure, live enough."</p>

<p>"Never," said Guy, turning up his nose.</p>

<p>"Why, a badger&mdash;&mdash;" And he put his thumb
and finger to his nostrils, with a sign which meant
more than words.</p>

<p>"I knaw a man," said the cobbler, confidentially,
"who have slept with a badger for ten
year, come next Michaelmas Fair goose day.
And he got so accustomed to it that he cudn't
sleep apart. Would 'ee like to see the badger?"</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"And the man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly. One of Nature's freaks."</p>

<p>"Two ov em!" said Reuben, solemnly, putting
in the last stitch, and handing the shoe to Guy.</p>

<p>"You'd like to see what's to be seen, s'poase?"</p>

<p>The cobbler whistled shrilly whilst untying
his apron, and a woman with dark hazel eyes,
and a face aquiline and refined, appeared. Guy
made his best bow.</p>

<p>"The gentleman do want to see the badger
that the man slept with," said Reuben, slowly.</p>

<p>"And the man, I should like to see the man
who had such extraordinary taste," added Guy,
saying something just to enable him to look at
the woman without being rude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman reddened, and her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"Tell un, my dear, what name you owned to
avoor you was married," said the cobbler.</p>

<p>"Badger; and too good for you," replied the
lady.</p>

<p>"That's the badger, and this is the man,"
said the cobbler, with a smile.</p>

<p>Guy was very cross when he told the story.
Only to think that he had painted London town
and London wit in such colours; and then to be
dropped on by a simple cobbler before a handsome
woman! But he wasn't cross long, and he
went out and bought a pretty chain, and gave it
to the cobbler to lead his "badger" with. So
Guy and the cobbler cried quits.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Parson trumps.</span></p>

<p>To be able to do a "clane off trick" is to be
the hero in a parish for generations, and Parson
Arscott was quoted at all the fairs as a masterpiece
for doing the thing clane off at a horse deal.
The story goes that the reverend gentleman
attended Summercourt Fair, which is famed
throughout the land. If you can't get what you
want at Summercourt Fair, you must be hard to
please, for the lame and the blind are there, the
young and the aged, the sound and unsound, and
you buy on your own judgment and without
warranty. Parson Arscott knew a good horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
when he saw it, and went early and looked about
him. In the thick of the fair the parson went
and examined the horses' tails, and so attracted
attention to himself, for every one knows that to
tell a horse's age you must open its mouth, and
look at its teeth. And the curious part of the
business was that the parson knew as much about
the animal he was handling by lifting its tail as
other people did by opening its mouth. At
length, parson came to a nice little cob that
suited him, and the deal began. It was a weary
deal, but parson was firm. "I've looked at his
tail, and I know he's rising five," said he; and
he was right,&mdash;whatever the parson said about
the cob was right, and yet he never once looked
at its mouth. There was a trifle of five pounds
between them when the shades of evening began
to fall, and no hope of any advance on the part
of the parson. At last the dealer said, "Tell me
how you know a horse's age by his tail, and you
shall have the cob." The parson counted down
the guineas, and whispered, "I looked into his
mouth beforehand." "Parson Arscott's deal"
makes a horse-dealer shiver to this day.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Parson euchred.</span></p>

<p>But sharp as the parson was at the fair, he
was no match for a woman on her own ground.
Parson was round collecting his tithes, and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
to a farm whereon the farmer's wife presented
her husband with a tenth child, and an old sow
littered ten years.</p>

<p>"Passun es out in the town plaace, and es
coom vur th' tithe pig. Which shall us giv'm?"
asked the farmer of his better half, sitting in the
kitchen suckling her baby.</p>

<p>"Tithe pig, es et? What next, I wonder?
I'll tithe pig'n," says Mrs. Farmer, rising and
taking the infant with her.</p>

<p>The parson was very polite, of course, to
Mrs. Farmer and number ten, and asked about
the christening.</p>

<p>"That's vur you to zay, passun," says the
lady, holding out number ten. "He do belong
to you."</p>

<p>The parson flushed. This was not in his line.</p>

<p>"Ess sure 'e do&mdash;tes the tithing cheeld, and
now you take un."</p>

<p>Farmer made his appearance with the weakliest
of the ten vears squealing in his arms, and
the parson made towards him, but the woman
was equal to the occasion and stood between
them, shouting, "No cheeld, no vear," and that
time she had her way, and saved the little pig.</p>

<p>So there arose a saying in the parish that a
parson might cheat the devil, but a woman could
cheat a parson.</p>

<p>"Every one to his trade," said Guy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To be "sure for sartin" is an averment of
absolute knowledge, but a Cornishman is not
often willing to speak to anything in so pronounced
a fashion. To be "sure as can be"
admits of a loophole and many explanations in
the event of error. Something non-committal in
the shape of speech suits him best. Things of
no consequence become mysterious when screened
with secrecy. An ordinary conversation is like
this&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Down along."</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>"Past the corner."</p>

<p>"How far?"</p>

<p>"A pure bit."</p>

<p>"Will you be long?"</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"Say an hour?"</p>

<p>"If you like."</p>

<p>"Or two?"</p>

<p>"Shudn't wonder."</p>

<p>And so on, and so on, until the questioner is
tired of asking further questions. The people
don't notice anything peculiar about this want of
directness in reply to the simplest questions. To
tell the truth, and yet to mislead, is looked on as
an accomplishment which may be turned to profit
without scandal, as by the man who sold a blind
horse as free from vice. "To be blind is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
misfortune and not a vice," replied the seller,
when charged with deceit.</p>

<p>Cornish diamonds are hard to beat on a deal.
We chanced upon a couple one market day
chaffering about a pig in a tap-room.</p>

<p>"Twenty score weight, and fippence a pound."</p>

<p>"Fourpence ha'penny, and I'll take the head
and oal ov'm."</p>

<p>"An' barley eighteen shillin' a bushel! I'll
see to it."</p>

<p>One hour already by the clock had been
consumed by the little farmer who had a pig to
sell, and the little pork-butcher who wanted to
buy one, and there was this ha'penny between
them. Friendly customers chaffed a bit and
threw in a word between drinks, and it seemed
that the jobber who could keep a stiff upper lip
and his temper longest would come out on top.
The unfortunate pig was haggled over with and
without the hams, with and without the bacon
fat, with one ham only, with its head, without
its head, with only half its head, and every
cunning offer of the little pork-butcher was
resisted with a fineness of perception of self-interest
that would have done credit to the peace
plenipotentiaries at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Another hour passed, and the butcher advanced
one farthing&mdash;fourpence three-farthings, but without
the head, and then there was the "luck
penny." At last the whole carcase was sold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
head and all, at fourpence three-farthings, and
the "luck penny" was "spent out." It was a
hard deal, and neither seemed too well pleased.
Only the customers all said it was a fair bargain,
and seemed pleased when the men shook hands
over it.</p>

Life</span> on a farm by the roar of the
sea approaches the ideal upon
earth. It isn't quite the ideal,
because the ideal is always round
the corner; but it is near it, and
that is something to be thankful
for. Mrs. Andrawartha ran the farm, and she
had two tall, strapping sons and a daughter. Mrs.
Andrawartha was what is called a "comfortable"
woman; and "comfort" is the one virtue prized
above rubies in these parts.</p>

</div>

<p>It was through accident that we struck the
farm one afternoon, the fact being that the Bookworm
was limping, having slightly sprained his
ankle. There wasn't much to recommend us at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
first sight&mdash;three dusty wayfarers, with small
knapsacks, and no warts or other indications of
royal lineage upon either of us. The farmhouse
was situated in an old-fashioned garden, and a
good, roomy porch, with seats on either side,
offered hospitality. Open windows were visible
through luxuriant fuchsias and creepers, but what
the walls were built of no one could tell, so completely
covered were they with flowering plants.
It was a sort of place which wanted to be looked
at again and again, something fresh coming into
view each time; and the oftener you looked at it
the more you liked it.</p>

<p>The Bookworm rapped modestly with his
knuckles upon the thick door, but no one came.
We could hear voices, and an aromatic perfume
filled the passage. The Bookworm tried again,
and only hurt his knuckles. Then Guy said
he'd negociate, and if he got into trouble we
were there to help him. The smell of burning
furze and brambles guided him to the great kitchen,
and he winked again and coughed as the smoke
from the wide open fireplace filled his eyes.
There was a little maid heaping up the thorns
and brambles, and somewhere in the blue haze
he saw the supple outline of a young girl, with
her arms bare. They were heating the brick
oven for bread-baking. A very sweet voice
floated through the film of blue, aromatic smoke.
A sudden draught cleared the smoke, and Guy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
stood face to face with the owner of the voice;
and a nice face it was, now radiant with the heat
from the burning brambles. The bare arms were
dimpled, and the whole figure was cased in a
white wrapper, showing to perfection the clear
skin, and brown hair, and light hazel eyes of the
young girl. This was Miss Andrawartha.</p>

<p>Mrs. Andrawartha was in the "living-room"
(and a nice room it was), overlooking much of the
farm land, the sea beyond, and the great cliffs,
rising sheer from the yellow sands, playing hide-and-seek
between them. The lady was portly,
and sat in a chair made for comfort before the
open window, and Guy, ushered into the presence
of such homely dignity, wished to stammer an
excuse, and back out. Remembrance of the
sprained foot alone restrained him.</p>

<p>"You can stop here as long as you've a mind
to, if only you behave yourselves," said the lady
in the chair.</p>

<p>"Three of us?" queried Guy.</p>

<p>"The house is big enough," said the lady.</p>

<p>Guy made a rush for the porch. "Come in,
you beggars," said he; "there's a queen inside,
and a divinity in the kitchen."</p>

<p>At the evening meal we were incorporated
with the family. Mrs. Andrawartha, in her chair
of comfort, presided, supported by her two tall
sons, then us, then the farm servants, and the
daughter of the house at the other end of the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Our presence made no difference to the social
economy of the farm, except that Mrs. Andrawartha
presided over a late breakfast in the living-room.
This was quite a personal compliment,
and never could woman look more "comfortable"
than the widow Andrawartha at table.</p>

<p>"If this is farm life, I'm a convert for ever,"
said Guy, chipping an egg and catching the white
cream in his spoon.</p>

<p>The bread, just perfumed with the aroma of
the burning furze with which the clome oven was
heated, was delicious by itself, but with the butter
thick upon it, the palate rose to the occasion and
was satisfied. The home-cured ham in front of
the comfortable widow would take no denial, and
must be tasted. The cream, with its sheen of
gold, and the honey, winking wickedly at the
cream, would not be put aside; so there was
nothing for it but to mix them both in holy matrimony
upon the perfumed bed of bread. There
was such a blend of delicate flavours and sightly
delicacies that our eyes would shut, so that nothing
might interfere with the joys of taste. Only a
few flowers were on the table, but through the
open window floated the scents of the garden,
and the bees hummed and waltzed, and there was
room for all, and to spare, at the table of the
comfortable widow.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" said Guy. "I shall never
forget. Such everything! Only the worst of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
is, I shall never like anything again for evermore.
Fancy shop eggs, and 'best Dosset,' and alumed
bread, and stale ham after this feast of the gods,
when they lived among men. There's one saint
still in Cornwall&mdash;the saint of good things at the
shrine of the comfortable widow."</p>

<p>We left the Bookworm to himself and the odd
volumes of the <i>Arminian Magazine</i>, and suchlike
food for such as he, and he seemed as pleased
as Punch at the thought of being alone with anything
musty, fusty, and out of date.</p>

<p>"Incurable," said Guy. "This reading habit
sticks to a fellow of his sort, like dram-drinking
to a tramp."</p>

<p>Guy was in the seventh heaven of delight
when the daughter of the house told him that in
an orchard, through which the brook ran to the
sea, there were some trout. Her father used to
bring home "a fine passul" sometimes, and his
rod and lines were all in the house, for the boys
never troubled the fish. So Guy went a-fishing,
his heart full of content with his breakfast, and
susceptible to the diviner impressions which the
daughter of the house in blue print and white
apron might make upon him. The boys called
her "Phil," but her name was Phyllis; he had
got so far as that, when the widow's voice awoke
him from contemplation of eyes and hair, and all
the points which young men like to study at
chance meetings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>He found the brook, and then the orchard.
The water was as bright as glass, and the sun-motes
danced upon it between the shadows.
Trout there were in the stream, but they had not
tasted a worm for a month, except by chance,
and the flies were not to their liking. Guy
walked up stream to where the brook was fed by
two trickling rills, where there was some depth
of water, and an old, overhanging bank, and
current enough for his fly to sail downward,
temptingly, to the eyes of adventurous trout
wanting to see life. At the deepest part the
stream was shadowed by a large apple tree, and
here Guy changed his flies, and cast deftly towards
the spot where he felt sure the king of the stream
must linger, if, indeed, it had a king. Presently,
a melodious splash above his own fly told its
secret, and Guy's hopes rose until he caught a
little beauty, and then another, and another, and
laid them on the grass, covering them with dock
leaves with loving tenderness. Small fry that he
would have been thankful for on other days he
returned to the stream with words of advice.</p>

<p>Breakfast doesn't last for ever, and Guy
began to feel peckish, but he wasn't going to
give up yet, not he. He'd take home a fry of
trout which would send an incense above the
farm to the blue heavens, and make all invisible
spirits envious. Presently he heard dry branches
breaking under a light footstep, and the daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of the farm stood by him, a ministering angel,
with a pasty and a bottle of milk in a basket
covered with a cloth of purest white. This was
what she used to do for her father, who wouldn't
leave off until he had a dish to his liking; and
mother, thinking all men who fished for trout
were the same, sent her with the basket of
"croust" to keep off the pangs. So the dainty
messenger. Then Guy uncovered his spoil, and
Phyllis played him artlessly, so that he, in his
turn, rose and bolted the sweet bait, and turned
to go down stream again, only to know that he
was in the toils, unless the fair angler should let
him go.</p>

<p>She must go herself now, and Guy, who could
not get away on his own account, felt grieved
that release must come. It was sudden, but
irresistible, and the thrilling exquisite. Then
came the shock. "I am bespoke already, sir."
The line parted.</p>

<p>Guy fished and fished until after sunset,
but joy of capture was gone. He had himself
been captured, and felt pity. Still he brought
home a fine basket, and the comfortable widow
served them up for breakfast, whole, and still
beautiful.</p>

<p>The Bookworm, nursing his slight sprain,
enjoyed himself in his own fashion, and, rummaging
at the back of the open book-case, unearthed
a book, bound in parchment, which commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
with farm accounts, and ended with "Receipts
and Charms for the Cure of Man and Beastes."
The pages were undated, but were written a
hundred years ago by one Andrawartha, grandfather
of the comfortable widow's husband. The
document bore the following preface:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lest I forget what has been told to me,
I commit to paper charms and other devices for
the cure of men and beastes. My forbears used
these charms for more years than I can tell, and
those who use them must have faith in them that
they will work their work, or they labour in vain.
And I pray God that I commit no sin in handing
down what I have been taught, but that it may
be counted merit in me to preserve what has
been found out with much labour, and hath spared
man and beast great and grievous sufferings in
the flesh, and saved much money, when it could
ill be spent, as, God wot, is the case on farms in
this country.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Mortal are we and subject to diseases,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We all must die even when and how God pleases!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the world but one way we do come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand ways from hence we are sent home.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some of the receipts would offend moderns,
but all were seemingly set down in good faith;
and the Bookworm copied many, with permission.</p>

<p>"A tooth from a dead man's mouth carried in
the pocket is an infallible charm against toothache."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"The eighth psalm read three times a day,
three days running, cures the thrush."</p>

<p>"To keep away evil spirits from cattle, nail
four horse-shoes in the form of a cross against
the door."</p>

<p>"A church key applied to a wound stops
bleeding."</p>

<p>"Bore a hole in a nutmeg and tie round your
neck, and nibble nine mornings fasting, and boils
will disappear in spring and autumn."</p>

<p>"Breathe over a newly made grave, and cure
a cough."</p>

<p>"Take spoonful of earth from grave of newly
interred virgin, dissolve in water, and drink fasting,
to cure 'decline.'"</p>

<p>"Toad's liver fried is good for rheumatism, so
also are adders' tails; the adders must be killed
whilst dew is on them."</p>

<p>"The sign of the cross drawn on wood, stone,
or metal, and bound over a wound, stops bleeding
in man or beast."</p>

<p>For toothache was this formula: "Upon a
rock St. Peter stood, towards Jerusalem. And
Peter prayed, 'Lord, forgive me my sins, and I
shall be free. In the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.&mdash;Amen.' Say
three times a day, three days running, and drink
powdered brimstone water between whiles."</p>

<p>To cure heartache: "Sleep with key of
church door around your neck."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Water taken from church font is good for
children with rickets, and will straighten bow-legged
children, and children with 'wobbles.'"</p>

<p>"Black spiders dried and powdered cure
heart-burn." There were many other cures for
heart-burn, and all of them nasty, so nasty that
spider-powder sprinkled in water was dainty by
comparison.</p>

<p>Meteorolites and curious stones when ground
to powder will cure men or beasts of all common
diseases, and blue snake-stones are infallible in
case of snake-bite.</p>

<p>There were love philtres innumerable, and
it appeared that a deserted maid had only to
steal her lover's jacket, turn the sleeves inside
out, bury it at midnight in a churchyard, and
then, presto! the lover's heart would turn, and
turn, as the jacket rotted in the ground, until he
came back repentant to his ancient flame.</p>

<p>The Bookworm made notes of many other
things which would do for the curious in such
matters, and remarked as singular that, in all the
book, there was no reference to saints or invocations
to saints, which, he said, was very strange in
the land of saints. Guy confessed that the matter
was beyond him, and said he did not care if he
never heard the word "saint" again. Saint this,
and saint that, and saint the other&mdash;there was too
much of it in one small county, to his taste.</p>

Mrs. Andrawartha</span> took
kindly to the Bookworm; he
was the lame duck of the party,
and so she took a motherly
interest in him, and got him to
talk about himself and his sleepless,
restless nights, until he came into this land
wherein Nature was at rest, beautifying herself
after passionate upheavals. And then she told
him fairy stories about piskies with half-shy
credulity, and sorrow in her face and voice that
the old order had changed and given place to
new. In her young days a pedlar with a big dog
used to travel from farmhouse to farmhouse,
and always got hospitality in exchange for news.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
At night all the household crowded around the
pedlar to hear him fiddle and sing, and tell stories
of the piskies, and of men who listened to the
songs of mermaids, and disappeared from family
and life. This pedlar&mdash;"Uncle" Anthony he
was called&mdash;was a poet, and his piskies were
real, as real as sunshine and shadow and the
music of the birds. He knew them by name
and talked to them, and met them by moonlight
on the moors, and what "Uncle" Anthony said
was gospel truth.</p>

<div class="caption">THE OLD MILL.</div>
</div>

<p>There was an old miller, living at an old mill
not so very far away, who had the reputation of
knowing more about piskies than any man
breathing. It was only a walking distance for
the Bookworm, and Guy took his rod with him,
having been told that below the mill he might
cast a fly with some prospect of sport. Whipping
a stream is something, and Guy said he'd rather
cast at shadows than hang about a dusty old mill,
listening to a foolish old man prating about
foolish things. In fact, he was a little strong in
his language, as he usually was when talking
about people or things which did not interest him
very much.</p>

<p>The old piskie man at the mill was, in fact,
the Bookworm's "find," which was quite enough,
as a rule, to put Guy in opposition, and incline
him to use epigrammatic language touched
with red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>We reached the mill, the like of which is
hardly to be found again within the four corners
of the kingdom. It was a one-story building,
and that so low that we had to be careful when
inside not to knock our heads against the beams,
and the machinery was as primitive as the process
of grinding corn between revolving stones driven
by water power. The ancient hopper was being
slowly consumed by worms, and the "bolting"
cloths hung limp and dusty, like the cloths sent
home from Egyptian tombs. We first spied
the miller looking through a ventilation hole,
which served as a window. When we entered
the mill he was sitting on the lid of a thick oak
chest, which had outlived the centuries, and
seemed quite capable of lasting for ever.</p>

<p>The miller was withered, like the chest, and
might have been believed if he said he was as
old as the mill, only his eyes were bright and
ferrety as they took stock of us through the
flour dust accumulated on his eyebrows and
lashes&mdash;a sort of flour mummy outside of his
grave-clothes out for an airing, he looked. The
machinery was in motion when we entered, and
a fine dust soon settled upon us, and then set us
coughing and choking, so that we made a hasty
retreat through the door, the top half of which
was already open.</p>

<p>The miller's cottage was a thatched dwelling
tacked on to the mill, which was also thatched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
but nothing was visible of the cottage but
windows, on account of the clustering roses and
myrtles and fuschias which clung to the old
"cob" walls, and crept along the eaves, and
scrambled along the thatch.</p>

<p>The old miller followed us out into the open,
and stopped the wheel by turning off the water;
and then we noticed that the dripping wheel was
festooned with lichen, and was half-hidden under
the shadow of a huge flowering laurel. There
were only three other cottages in the village, and
these were all flower-laden; and now the clat,
clat, clatter of the old wheel was stopped, the air
was musical with the hum of insect symphonies.
And then the perfume!</p>

<p>We looked at one another and wondered.</p>

<p>"Quiet like," said the old man; and that was
all he had to say about this antique gem in a
garden of myrtles and roses. "Quiet like,"
indeed! Surely men may live in beauty until
they cease to see it.</p>

<p>We were out piskie-hunting to-day, all except
Guy, who already had his eye upon the stream
which passed the old mill, then broadened where
it could be seen glistening in the sunshine. He
wasn't long before he deserted us, and we were
not sorry, being sure that if he once commenced
questioning the miller in his off-hand manner, the
old man would dry up quickly, and we should
hear little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bookworm took the old man's fancy by
telling him about a new process for grinding flour
between rollers so hard that they could only be
cut by diamonds, and then, with many windings,
got on the track of the piskies. He took a lot
of starting, it is true, but when once started he
covered a good deal of ground. He would take
his own course, and a crooked one it was, but
capable of being straightened out, which is more
than can truly be said of the discourses of some
very learned people.</p>

<p>He was as "sure and sartin" that piskies
were real beings, and existed even now, as that
"water was wet," and he ought to know, because
there was a piskie which belonged to the old
mill. There was some trouble one day at the
mill about the non-delivery of "grist," the miller
being charged with taking unfair toll, and he
shifted the responsibility on to his wife, who
thereupon transferred the blame to the piskie,
as the person least likely to suffer in consequence.
It so happened that the piskie got to know of
the slander, and he came to the mill in a great
rage, and swore an oath binding in fairyland, not
to do another stroke of work in the old mill for
two generations.</p>

<p>"When I was a boy," said the old man, "I
used to see the piskie that belonged to the mill
sitting on the stones when they were grinding as
comfortable as a fly would rest upon a turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
wheel. And why not? When my father went
to market, and stopped away days, when there
was no need, the work was done all the same.
My father liked that very well, only the piskie
would give too good 'tummels' when he filled
the sacks; and when my father took too much
toll, then he would tickle the palm of his hand,
and make it itch, to remind him that he was
cheating. When a miller is honest, a tuft of hair
grows in the middle of his palm; but it didn't
ever sprout in my fathers, which made him poor-tempered
sometimes. The piskie was in the
shape of a man&mdash;very dark, black-haired, and
cross-eyed. He could work best, the old folks
said, when not seen; only his voice was large for
his size, and made people know when he was
about. He was the spirit of the mill, and belonged
to it, so there was no question of payment;
and the children grew knowing he was there, and
were not afraid. Why should they be? When
the piskie said he would do no more work for two
generations, my father stuck to work himself,
which was better for him in the long run; and
I've had to stick to it, and shall stick to it till
I die, and then the piskie will be free to come
again."</p>

<p>"And are there piskies now?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But do people believe in
them?" asked the Bookworm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>The old miller seemed to resent the question,
and was so long in replying that we thought we
had made a mess of it. It, however, appeared
that he was only thinking; and at last he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"For sartin sure they do. You can't make
butter if the piskies turn the cream against the
sun, and every dairymaid will tell 'ee so. If the
piskie up to Barton farm has a spite against a
new maid, he'll spoil her baking of bread, so that
the bread will come out of the oven full of
'piskie-spits,' and he'll play her tricks until she
is turned out of the house. When I was a boy,
the piskies used to have fine fun with the maidens
up to Barton on winter nights when all the work
was done. They used to blaw out the candles
and kiss the maids, and the maids would screech
and find fault with the boys, and 'scat their
chacks' for being too free in the dark. The
piskies were full of fun, and would whisper
in a maid's ear when she was sleeping, and tickle
her nose to wake her when she had bad dreams.
When the maids were courting they'd lead 'em
a pretty dance, and drive 'em to quarrel with
their sweethearts, and then help 'em to make it
up again."</p>

<p>But the old man did not think they were as
plentiful as they used to be, for the simple reason
that people had learnt to do without them. What
would be the good of the piskies in the harvest-field
now, when everything was done by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
machinery; or in dairies, where butter was made
in churns; or in flour-mills, where corn was
broken between rollers so hard that a diamond
could only scratch them? The old man found
it as hard to swallow the Bookworm's description
of roller mills as we found it to swallow his
stories, and his were much more inviting. The
ancient miller rambled on and on, telling us of
tricks played upon his very own grandfather,
who, returning from market with more brandy
toddy under his belt than his weak head could
carry, dared to cross a piskie ring on the moor
without first turning his pockets inside out by
way of homage. The poor man was pinched
black and blue, was bound with bonds innumerable,
no thicker than spiders' webs, and then, to
tantalize him, his eyes were "struck" with magic
unguent, and he was able to see the feasting and
rioting going on all around him, without being
able to enjoy the situation&mdash;all of which he did
most steadfastly believe.</p>

<p>"Blow the piskies!" said Guy, rejoining us
without warning. "Blow the piskies! Did you
ever catch one, Master Miller?"</p>

<p>A look of horror passed over the withered
old face, which made it look uncanny. Catch a
piskie, indeed! Had he been asked whether
he'd ever robbed a church, he might have taken
it less seriously.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Guy, airily, seeing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
he'd been guilty of something&mdash;"never mind; if
you never have, you still may. Specimens getting
scarcer, suppose, and a bit expensive; only, you
just pin one on to a card and send it to me registered,
for safety, and I'll come down handsomely."</p>

<p>The old man never recovered power of speech
while we were with him, and he shook hands
with the Bookworm and me automatically. We
left him with eyes wide open, staring before him.
I don't think he quite understood Guy's humour.
The idea of catching a piskie and pinning it to a
card, like small boys do cockchafers, came too
suddenly upon him. Then to register a piskie
and send it through the post-office&mdash;deporting
an ancient divinity under a postage stamp&mdash;set
up ideas which wanted thinking out.</p>

<p>I told Guy I feared the shock would be too
much for the old man; but he only laughed, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blow the piskie, and look at my beauty!"</p>

<p>He had managed to catch a trout too small
for anything, and he patted himself on the back,
and talked about it until he really believed he
had done something deserving the world's
gratitude.</p>

<p>"After all," said the Bookworm, when tired
of listening to Guy and "fly" this or "fly" the
other&mdash;"after all, there's no great difference
between Guy and the miller. Guy's little trout
has become a fairy already, and to-morrow will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
be even more wonderful than the miller's piskies.
The mind's receptivity must&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I know I lost a great deal, and ought to be
sorry for it, I dare say; but the word "receptivity"
was too much, and I managed to escape
that time.</p>

There</span> was a queer, dried stick of
a man at the farm whom we
never heard speak except to say
"Ess, maister," and "zackly."
His name was Jacob, and he was
famous for having given a shrewd
answer on one occasion when asked how he knew
when he had had enough to eat. "When I do
feel my buttons," said he; and people then said
that Jacob was wiser than he looked, which was,
no doubt, true, for he did not look very wise.
The old boy had a trick of wandering about at
nights, and was credited with having seen strange
things which he was "a nation sight too artful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
talk about." After the evening meal Mrs. Andrawartha
induced him to stay with us, and tell us
the story of something which happened at a
neighbouring farm. Jacob was reared on the
place, and so knew all about it. The widow
translated as he went along, and the story ran
like this:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jacob's Piskie Story.</span></p>

<p>A farmer, Nicholas Annear by name, was
known far and wide as Ould Hurry-all. Every
one about him was always glad to see his back
turned, so as to have "a bit" of peace and quietness
in the house. His wife was just the opposite,
and took things easy, and when Nickey was going
to drive to market in his cart, he nearly drove
every one on the place mazed. 'Twas hurry,
hurry, hurry all the time; and one day he was
worse than ever, and broke all the clome dishes
in his tantrums. The poor woman threw her
apron over her head, and began to weep and sob
so as to be heard a mile off.</p>

<p>Now, you must know, there's a little man
piskie which belonged to the Missus's family, and
came with her to her new home when she was
married. He used to do odd jobs for her to
make things go smooth when Nickey was taisey-like,
which was every day now, for he got worse
with age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter, Missus?" asks the little
man.</p>

<p>"I wish I was dead," says Missus. "That
Nickey'll drive me as mad as a curly, an' I'm
only a shadder now."</p>

<p>She weighed ten score, but she thought she
was failing.</p>

<p>"I'll give'm a lesson," says the little man.</p>

<p>Now, what did the piskie do? He hopped
on to the cart by the side of Nickey, only Nickey
couldn't see him, and he made a picture right
before his very eyes so that he saw the church
tower standing in the market-place as large as
life. And he drove and he drove, hurry, hurry
all the time, and he'd scarce give himself time to
speak a civil word to people as he passed along.
He drove, and he drove, and he drove, and there
was the church tower before him. The pigs in
the cart squealed louder and louder as they got
more and more famished, and the horse began
to fail, and Nickey got madder and madder.
Evening began to fall, and still the church tower
was in front of him; and then night came, and
the pigs were quiet through hunger, and the
horse could scarcely put one leg before the other.</p>

<p>And what did the little man do? Oh, he was
artful. When the market was all over, and night
came, he removed the picture of the church tower
in the market-place from Nickey's eyes, and, lo
and behold! the horse was standing, dead tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and ready to drop, outside of the very gate which
it had been driven from in the morning.</p>

<p>Nicholas Annear was a reformed man after
that, and was no more in a hurry over things
than his neighbours. But the story got about,
of course, and the people have a saying now that
"a man in a hurry will be late to market."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Early Church seems to have had a great
deal of trouble with piskies, and every effort was
made to put the people out of love with them.
It was said that they were the souls of unbaptized
infants and servants of "Old Artful," and for that
reason they would neither enter a church nor come
within sound of church bells. But Mrs. Andrawartha
told us of a legend which goes back
further, namely, that piskies are the children of
Adam and Eve, who wouldn't be washed on
Saturday nights before going to bed. Those
who could get away did, to avoid having their
eyes filled with soap, and two hid away so effectually
that they were never found again, although
Adam and Eve sent the crier round, and then
cried themselves until they were tired. These
wandering children lived upon fern-seed, mixed
with dew flavoured with sunbeams, until they
acquired the power of becoming invisible, and
then they returned home, and did household
work, and other things, for the family; but they
were like the famous soap that wouldn't wash.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
The old people used to tell children that they
would be turned into piskies if they wouldn't
have their Saturday-night tubbing and say their
prayers and go to bed.</p>

<p>There is a little brown moth called the
"piskie," and children are now told that if they
are not good these piskie-moths will play them
tricks in their sleep. The School Boards have
wrestled with the piskie and failed, and now the
County Council is in the ring. Still the piskie,
visible and invisible, lives.</p>

<p>The Bookworm was on his legs again, and
we all were sorry to leave the farm and the comfortable
widow. Guy managed to linger behind
and get a last word with Phyllis, the daughter of
the house, and exchange photographs, or, perhaps,
something dearer to romance. The two tall sons
walked with us "a pure distance," and told us the
names of the farms round about, names which
none but a native could ever remember. They
told us that the Andrawarthas had farmed this
land, from father to son, for over three centuries.
The eldest son was going to marry soon and
bring home his wife, but would not dispossess
his mother during her lifetime. Only the other
son would go afield&mdash;Australia or Canada&mdash;and
set up for himself; and Phyllis was to be married
soon to a neighbouring farmer, who would follow
his own father by-and-bye. Everything seemed
so orderly as they talked, as though the currents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of life flowed strong and deep, and the idea of
home was never disturbed. The young people
did not stay at home dividing and subdividing
lands and chattels until there was nothing to
divide, but went abroad and set up new homesteads,
calling them by the old names. Young
Andrawartha said, whether he settled in Canada
or Australia, he'd call his farm after the old place.
If he couldn't have anything else he'd have the
name to comfort him. Many of the young men
did that, he said, when they settled in a new place.</p>

<p>The Bookworm said Cornwall was a bigger
place than it looked, or than could be gripped
between the arms of the Atlantic, because of the
tributaries it sent all over the world, every man
taking with him a bit of Cornish earth and love,
and setting up a new colony beyond the seas,
just as the old Greeks carried with them some
of the fire from the ancient hearths.</p>

<p>Guy said he would remember the name of the
farm for the rest of his life, and he tramped along
with laggard steps, and would have given much
for an excuse to run back and find a dropped
handkerchief, and shake hands over again with
the comfortable widow, on the chance of seeing
Phyllis the bespoke. When we got off the estate,
and the young men left us, he wanted to know
whether it was possible to fancy the dainty
Phyllis as "comfortable" in days to come as her
portly mother?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>We turned round just to take a last look at
the farmhouse wherein we had been so well
treated. The dwelling and all the outhouses
made a goodly show, and, at a distance, the
yellow lichen&mdash;a poor, poverty-looking thing
enough&mdash;covering the roofs, had the appearance
of burnished gold. Nature here will insist on
dressing herself out in most unlikely places, and
has a trick of her own for covering up ugliness.
A flash of sunshine, a breath of air, a pinch of
dust kissed with dew, and flat slates on ugly roofs
are covered with cloth of gold for the tired feet
of winged spirits of the air. This was the last
view that three tramps had, and the remembrance
remains with them.</p>

<p>A Cornishman seldom travels without a pasty.
When small, a pasty is a snack; when large, it's
a meal. Mrs. Andrawartha gave each of us a
pasty to keep us from fainting by the way, just
the same as a considerate hostess elsewhere would
slip a packet of dainty sandwiches into the hands
of departing guests. "You'll find'm good," said
she, with honest pride; and we did.</p>

<p>The home of the pasty is Cornwall. It may
be met with in Devon, and is possible in Yorkshire,
but Cornwall is its home now. In a sense
the pasty is Cornish. There are other dishes,
but the pasty comes first, the making of which is
handed down from generation to generation.
Every created thing that may be eaten goes into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
a pasty&mdash;fish, flesh, or fowl, and the herb of the
field, whether sweet or sour, to say nothing of
fruits and humble potatoes and turnips. When a
woman has a rage for pasty-making, nothing
comes amiss when the strip of dough is ready.
There's a knack in turning out a shapely pasty
no longer than one's hand, or big enough for a
family to carve at and come again. All pasties
are alike on the outside; and the cable-twist running
from end to end, delicately tapering from the
centre towards the points, is a work of art to look
at. As the pasty goes to the oven, so it comes
out, puffed up a little with self-conscious pride at
having gone through the fiery trial and come out
a generous brown, with every cable-twist intact,
and every curve swelling with inward importance.
The origin of the pasty is lost with the language,
but the thing is universal, and the friend of all.
The workman takes it in his bag, the traveller
pops it in his pocket, the family sit around it.
No knife, no fork, no tablecloth is wanted; out
comes the pasty, and the feast begins. A pasty
fresh from the oven sends up an incense which
makes a hungry man thankful to be alive. A
man will call at a friend's house with his pasty in
his pocket, and the good woman will warm it for
him, and he'll join the family circle without any
one thinking it an intrusion. Tea is the drink
with a pasty. Anything else will do, from white
wine to cider; but tea is the drink for choice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>A pie is another Cornish dish, and lends itself
to the racial aptitude for secrecy. Almost anything
under the sun may be put into a pie, and
no one be the wiser, for the crust puts on a brave
face and hides the poverty (should there be
poverty) underneath. No end of stories have
been told of pies. A person in a sarcastic mood
has been known to send a neighbour a pie with a
halter in it; but the piskies did something better
than that, and sent the barren wife of the Earl of
Cornwall a pie which, when opened, was filled
with sweet herbs and wild flowers, in the midst
of which a little heir lay smiling. And then, as a
set-off, Old Nick comes in and watches a woman
make an "all-sorts" pie, in which nothing seemed
out of place; and so afraid was he that his own
dear self would be included that he skipped out
of the county. The pie, like the pasty, is a
mystery until it is opened, unless the crust is
decorated with the foot of a duck, or some other
indication of contents. The heads of pilchards
peeping through the crust suggested the name of
"star-gazey pie;" but a stranger in the land may
never see it&mdash;indeed, he may never see many
things.</p>

Through</span> August and down to the
middle of September is the season
for blackberries, and wherever
the bramble can grow, there the
black, luscious fruit hangs ripe
and tempting. The Bookworm
hazarded the guess, as we tramped along, that the
plant followed the Celtic immigration in Cornwall
and Brittany. The Bretons make money of the
fruit, but here whoever is minded may pick and
eat and carry away; and no one was ever prosecuted
for wandering over fields in search of the
fruit, and pulling down bits of hedges to secure it.
During the season, blackberry parties go out with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
crook-sticks and baskets, and faces as clean as
usual, and return tired and torn, with hands and
lips and faces dyed all over with the dark juice.
Some say it was the blackberry juice which the
ancient inhabitants used for frightening away the
Roman legions; but nothing positive is now
known. It is, however, the fact that the Cornish
dye just as much of themselves as is visible with
blackberry juice once a year; and this may be a
survival of an ancient custom. Just for a wonder,
it was neither saint nor piskie who was quoted in
connection with blackberries, but Old Nick himself,
who ate so many one thirteenth of September
that he felt real ill, and he cursed the
fruit with such a terrible curse that, after the fatal
thirteenth, the fruit is said to be unfit for food,
and is allowed to rot where it grows.</p>

<p>If the blackberry isn't a native, it ought to be,
considering the impudent way in which it takes
possession of the hedges and fences, scrambling
over everything, and sucking in all the sunshine
which comes out of the sky. Anywhere, everywhere
it grows, even along the bleak sea-cliffs
washed with sea-spray and ruffled with bitter
winds; but the fruit is most sweet and generous
when growing in sheltered spots on moor and in
valley. We were told to be sure to have blackberry
pie, and we had it at the farm; and if the
immortals didn't envy us when eating blackberry
pie, smothered with Mrs. Andrawartha's cream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
it's proof positive that they don't know about one
good thing in the eating line.</p>

<p>The Wesleyans are especially fond of blackberries.
Of course there's a reason for it. The
Bookworm stumbled on it, as usual, and we went
to the circuit minister, who said he was quite
right, and it was the fruit which kept John
Wesley alive on St. Hilary downs. The story
is all right, and can be verified in print. Here it
is: "One day we had been preaching on St.
Hilary down. As we returned, John Wesley
stopped his horse to pick the blackberries, saying,
'Brother Nelson, we ought to be thankful that
there are plenty of blackberries, for this is the
best county I ever saw for getting a stomach, and
the worst I ever saw for getting food.'" Guy
said there ought to be a blackberry day as well
as a primrose day. Why not? White roses and
orchids are consecrated to other illustrious persons,
and why not blackberries to John Wesley?</p>

<p>Of course the blackberry has its legend, and
this is one as it was told to us.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Romance of Princess Olwen.</span></p>

<p>The fairest princess in Cornwall, as every one
knew, was the daughter of Bran Dhu, and it was
the surprise of every one that his daughter should
be so fair when he was so dark, dark as his own
black heart; and that was dark enough, in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
conscience. More golden was her hair than the
flower of the furze, and her skin was whiter than
the foam of the wave. A twin sister she had
who favoured their father, and she was as dark
as a thunder-cloud, and as passionate as the other
was gentle. The twins grew up, and got on
very well together, until the son of the king
stopped at Bran Dhu's castle and received a cup
of milk from the hand of the fair princess, who
was called Olwen, when he ought to have received
it from Gertha, she of the flashing eyes and heart
of fire. Bran Dhu had made other arrangements
for his fair daughter, whom he removed the very
next day to the dwelling of a herdsman whose
wife was a witch, and who had strict orders not
to let the young prince see the fair princess, even
if he should chance upon her whereabouts. It
wasn't long before the young prince came again,
and this time Gertha handed him a cup of milk;
but he had no eyes for her, and rode away.
Whenever he came he only saw Gertha, and
rode away disappointed, which so wounded her
vanity that she ended by hating her sister of the
yellow hair and sea-foam skin. The young
prince went to his father, who commanded Bran
Dhu to come and see him, bringing the fair
Olwen with him. Now, Bran Dhu was a subtle
man, and told lies as naturally as other great
people, and he said that Olwen went on a visit in
the country and died, and was buried by the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
herdsman and his wife. He didn't mind telling
where Olwen really was, because the herd's
wife had orders to turn the fair young princess
into a bramble whenever the king or young
prince came in search of her. The young prince
was very much in love, and rode off to the herd's
house, and the herd's wife showed him the clothes
which Olwen had worn, and the mound covering
her, and the bramble thick with blossom festooning
the hedge. He was so sorrowful that he did
not notice that the bloom was out of season.
He came again and again and talked to the
herd's wife, for his heart was sore, and there was
always the bramble in full bloom.</p>

<p>Now, at the King's court there was a "wise
man," who smelt a rat as soon as ever he heard
about the bramble being in bloom, in season and
out of season, whenever the prince happened to
be there; so he turned the young prince into a
chough, and told him to fly over to the herdsman's
house and look around. The Cornish chough
was common enough in those days, and the old
witch took no notice of the black bird with red
beak hopping about the garden, its head on one
side, and one eye on Olwen the fair.</p>

<p>The "wise man," when he knew that Olwen
was really in the flesh, took in the whole situation.</p>

<p>The young prince flew over to the herdsman's
house and hopped around, and followed his lady
love until she got into a wood, when he resumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
his proper shape and told his love, sweet and
strong, and stayed so late that the old witch
caught him at it, and told Bran Dhu, who became
as mad as a hatter, and told Gertha, who became
madder than he. And they went over to the
herdsman's and ordered the witch to turn Olwen
into a bramble, and pour some magic drops upon
her fair blooms so that she should become green
and red and black in turns, sour to the taste, and
ugly to look upon.</p>

<p>Then the "wise man" anointed the beak of
the chough, saying, "Fly away and kiss the
bloom, and your love shall become sweet and
more sweet, and when the berry is sweetest to
your taste, pluck it and bring it to me."</p>

<p>And so he did. Then the "wise man" broke
the spell, and prince and princess were married;
but the bramble flourished and spread everywhere,
and all the people marvelled when they
ate of it or turned it into wine, as they do to this
day.</p>

<p>And all true lovers know that sweetest is the
love which has been hard to get, and has passed
through its sour and bitter stages and is plucked
when ripest.</p>

<div class="caption">PRINCESS OLWEN IS CHANGED INTO A BRAMBLE.</div>
</div>

<p>We saw a Cornish chough during our tramp;
but it is getting scarce now, and tens of thousands
of people may come and go without ever seeing
one. When the bird "with vermeil-tinted legs
and bright red beak" has quite vanished from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
old haunts, it will probably be held in the highest
esteem, like it once was when it lived in the
odour of sanctity. The chough was at one time
a sacred bird in Cornwall, just as the long-legged
ibis on the banks of the Nile, and, according to
the story, had secret relations with Old Nick,
just as its cousin, the raven, had in Wales. An
odour of sulphur may have been the consequence;
but as even birds may reform, the chough cut its
old acquaintance, and was selected as the future
habitation for the spirit of King Arthur. When
a Cornishman sees a chough he raises his
hat, if he has one, or pulls his forelock if he
hasn't, which means the same thing, namely, that
the chough is of sainted lineage, and worthy of
the very highest respect. It is not so easy to
see a chough now outside of a "collection."</p>

<p>The chough is of very aristocratic appearance,
and, in consequence, all poor and ragamuffin
and envious relations of the crow tribe are doing
their best to get rid of him by any means. No
doubt dynamite would be used if the crow
socialists knew how to handle it. It was an
unfortunate day for the chough when Shakespeare
advertised it as the "russet-pated chough,"
and that might not have been so very bad, only
it set some people saying that Shakespeare did
not know what he was talking about, which
provoked others to reply, and so the newspapers
debated whether Shakespeare should be criticized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Then all Cornwall was ransacked for choughs,
to see whether he was "russet-pated." If "pate"
means "head," then he isn't, but if "pate" means
"foot," then he is "russet-patted," or footed.
Those who held that the poet knew what he was
writing about, scored one; but the discussion cost
the chough dear, so many people finding it
necessary to shoot every chough they saw.
Every year King Arthur visits his own tomb
in the form of a chough, and some people hope
that <i>one</i> chough will be allowed to live in the
land just so long as the old King likes to revisit
his own grave and attend to its weeding. It
would be a pity for an old tradition to die out
for want of a bird to carry it on.</p>

A Cornish</span> "van" is a miracle on
wheels; but we're told that the
real, genuine article, like Penaluna's,
which still covers its five
miles in one hour and a quarter,
is getting rarer and more rare.
Penzance and Helston, Truro and Redruth, and
most of the market towns are visited on market
days by newly-painted antiquities on wheels.
They line up a street, or a square, for a few
hours, and then disappear again until the next
market day. The better class machine is a
"Royal Mail," or a "Standard," a "Comet," or
some such swagger thing; but "Penaluna's van"
has a first-grade certificate in the miracle line.
Rail and motor-cars have thinned out this ancient
sort of vehicle pretty considerably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Penaluna runs a refreshment house six
miles from a market town, and Mr. Penaluna is
the carrier by descent. For three generations
the Penalunas carried whatever there was to
carry, and it seems that when one machine wore
out, another was built after the same pattern,
and then another, and another, so that Penaluna's
van is now pretty much the same as its predecessors,
and the type has been preserved in
spite of steam and petrol. Mr. Penaluna's van
went to the market town twice a week, and Mr.
Penaluna's motto was to look after his parcels,
and let passengers take care of themselves. Our
traps were amongst the rest of the bales and
boxes and parcels, "stowed away" according to
the carrier's idea of the fitness of things. We
looked inside, and said we'd walk to the town
later in the day. We didn't see much accommodation
for passengers. We were mistaken.
One woman after another got into the van with
baskets of dairy produce and things, and settled
themselves somehow. The van was canvas-covered,
and its sides bulged, so we thought it
must be full. We didn't understand. People
came along with more baskets and got in, so
Guy said they must be sticking to the roof, feet
upwards, like flies. Every moment we expected
to see the van come apart, and let its contents
into the road; but it didn't, and held together
by force of habit, we supposed. Time was up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and we thought the good Mr. Penaluna would
start, but he was in no hurry; there was a
regular customer to come, and she always came
last. Somebody did come&mdash;a crowning glory of
twenty stun&mdash;with a girl by her side carrying
things. The "regular" waddled up, and said
it was warmish, and hands were spread out to
take in things and help the lady when she was
ready, and Mr. Penaluna was behind to give
a helpful push. The lady with liberal breadth
of beam and no featherweight disappeared, inch
by inch, and we stood by expecting to hear
shrieks from the inside victims. Only nothing
of the sort happened, and Mr. Penaluna closed
the door with a bang and the proud air of a
railway porter, and the living purgatory on
wheels waltzed away. Mr. Penaluna got up on
a swinging knifeboard, and cracked his whip
in a professional way about the ears of the wiry
pair of horses in front.</p>

<p>Guy asked Mrs. Penaluna whether she
thought that the women inside would come out
alive? which seemed to amuse her. She said
Penaluna might hap to pick up one or two more
on the road. "There's always room for one
more in Penaluna's van," said she, with a grand
sweep of the arm, indicating that a good slice
of creation might be carried to market twice a
week, and no mistake about it.</p>

<p>The Bookworm was under a promise not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
go past the first milestone, but to sit on it, and
wait until we overtook him. Guy said we
needn't hurry, as he saw him sneak a book into
his pocket, and he wouldn't know how the time
passed until the sun went down.</p>

<p>"If the little beggar can lose himself, he will,"
said Guy, jumping on a hedge and looking round.
Then he shouted "Coo-e-e-e-y!" and an answer
came a few yards off, where the Bookworm was
sitting on a heap of stones chatting to a man
with his sleeves turned up, and who was the
parish stonebreaker. This Mr. Stonebreaker
worked in a disused quarry, wherein he was
sheltered from all winds, and had for company
a sleek-looking donkey, which he rode to and
fro morning and evening. The Bookworm
struck the place just about luncheon-time. The
man had taken off his wire goggles, pulled out
his pasty, and the donkey's head rested on his
shoulder, waiting for the two ends of the pasty
to be put into its mouth. Mr. Stonebreaker
rolled up his jacket for the Bookworm to sit on,
and offered him a bit of pasty; and when we
joined the party of three, they made a very
pretty picture. The man was a droll fellow and
set the Bookworm laughing, and the animal
joined in in its very best style. The Bookworm
rose and shook hands with his newly-found
friend.</p>

<p>"Wasting the poor devil's time, and never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
tipped him, I'll bet," said Guy, with an air of
disgust.</p>

<p>"I couldn't," replied the Bookworm, the idea
that Guy thought him mean creeping over him.
"The man treated me as an equal, and played
the host, and how could I tip him?"</p>

<p>"You have sold the good name of every
tourist for evermore," said Guy, hastily; and
before we knew what he was up to, he bolted
back to the old quarry.</p>

<p>"Catch!" shouted he, spinning a coin towards
the man.</p>

<p>"Thank'ee kindly, but what be un vur?"</p>

<p>Then Guy made a speech, and the man
laughed, and returned the coin, without any sign
of displeasure.</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if a coin ever came back to
me in this way before. I shall keep it for luck,"
said Guy.</p>

<p>"Ef you bain't in a hurry I'll tell 'ee a story,"
said the man, as leisurely as though he were lord
of the manor.</p>

<p>"I shall be taking up your valuable time," said
Guy.</p>

<p>"Never mind me: we can afford it, caan't us,
old 'un?" (stroking the donkey's head). "Us can
al'ys find time when we do work by the day."
Then he began.</p>

<p>"You doan't know our Passun, s'poase? Well,
then, tedn't 'bout he, but the wan avoor, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
a purty field ov corn wan year, sure 'nuff, and
he hired Jim Tredinnick to come over and drash
un. Now, Passun was writing es sarmon, and
could heer Jim's drashal going wan, du, dre, like
a church bell tolling for a burying. 'This will
never do,' saith Passun to hisself, and down he
goes to the barn, and Jim was there making
believe to sweat a leak, and the ould drashal was
going wan, du, dre, like the church bell. 'The
man'll eat up the vally of the corn in the drashing
ov it,' said Passun, as he went back to his
room. Now, whether Passun falled asleep, or
dramed weth his eyes wide open, or whether it
was rale, I dunno, but the piskie that used to
belong to the place stood avoor him weth es
drashdals over his shoulder. Now Passun wasn't
proud, and telled him about Jim Tredinnick, how
he was hired by the day and his meat to drash
the corn in the barn, and 'I shall be ate out ov
house and home,' said Passun, 'he is that slow.'</p>

<p>"Then the little man laughed, and took the
drashels off his shoulders, and began to beat on
the floor, stroke by stroke with Jim Tredinnick in
the barn, and he made a tune ov it, like this:
'By the day, by the day, by the day-day-day.
By the day, by the day, by the day-day-day.'
'Twas slow music, sure; but 'twas what Jim
Tredinnick was making in the barn. Then the
little man changed it, and worked his drashels
lively, and the tune he made was like this: 'By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the job, by the job, by the job-job-job; by the
job, by the job, by the job,' as quick as you
plaise. Then Passun rubbed es eyes, and went
over to the barn, and made a fresh bargain with
Jim Tredinnick, and his corn was oal drashed
that very night."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Guy, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"If I had been breaking these stones by the
job you wouldn't have heard this story," said the
man, with a humorous twist of his mouth.</p>

<p>"You're a genius," said Guy, shying a
shilling at him, and running away at top speed.</p>

<p>"The fellow is a millionaire," said Guy,
overtaking us. "I shall never be able to say I
haven't met a rich man. I had to shy the coin
at him, and I don't know now whether he'll
trouble to pick it up."</p>

<p>"He's a gentleman, and his donkey knows
it," said the Bookworm; and it was his last word
on the subject.</p>

Three</span> occupations are followed&mdash;farming,
mining, and fishing, but
the Cornish are a handy race,
and it is not an uncommon thing
for a man to cultivate a farm,
work in a mine, and fish in the
sea. A "wheelbarrow farm" is a small holding
which a man may get along with, with the assistance
of a wheelbarrow, and is common enough in
the mining districts. When a mine is near the
sea, the wheelbarrow farmer has a boat, and puts
in time fishing when not underground. There
are no factories, as understood elsewhere, and if
you see smoke afar off, it's just some farmer
burning weeds, or a railway engine puffing along.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
There's never smoke enough in any one place to
soil a butterfly's wing, and some medical men
have already made note of the fact.</p>

<p>In <i>the</i> mining district people talk tin and
copper, and dream about little else, though it's
tin for choice. Redruth is the reputed headquarters
of the tin worship. When we reached
the town, everybody seemed to be in the street,
talking at once. We thought some great calamity
had happened, but found out that it was only the
usual when men came in from Camborne, and
round about. There is an inner temple, called
an Exchange, but most of the exchanging seems
to be done in the street. Men talk together, and
then out come little note-books. It looks like
street-betting, but the policeman takes no notice,
so, of course, it's something else. Millions sterling
have changed hands in this way, and in this
street, but we were told that times were dull
now. People were lively enough, and whether
they win or lose, they go on talking and dreaming
of tin.</p>

<p>It has been a wonderful land, this, and the
stories told of fortunes made in tin and copper
give fairy tales a back seat; but then, for every
fortune made, a fortune is lost; and the way to
get ten shillings worth of tin is to melt twenty
shillings worth of gold, we were told. Of course,
there's the other side, but we hadn't time to go
into it&mdash;it was too much like fiscal politics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>The people about here are prosperous to
look at, but we were told that they were ruined
regularly once a week or fortnight, as the case
may be. Strangers may make mistakes when
they see ruined people for the first time, but they
get to know that when a tin man looks most
prosperous, he's most ruined. A copper man
may be afflicted in the same way, but tin was
uppermost when we were in the place.</p>

<p>The great men in these parts are captains&mdash;mine
captains. A Newmarket horse-trainer and
jockey combined is not more looked up to on the
heath than a mine captain here. He is the man
who knows, and can put a friend on to a good
thing; people always think a mine captain has a
good thing up his sleeve, and you must be civil
to him, to make him shake it out. They are
modest men, however, and live in small houses to
check any tendency to pride, and on Sundays
Cap'n Jack and Cap'n Jose, and the best samples,
go preaching. The kingdom of heaven is very
much like a mine to a miner, and if she "cuts
rich" he wants to be there.</p>

<p>A mine is "she," and has many wooers when
rich, or reputed to have great expectations.
Mines in these parts are also feminine in the
coquettish way in which they show just sufficient
of their attractions at one time to lure men on
and on, and then&mdash;nothing! The caprices of a
season's beauty are not greater than those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
a mine, nor is the condition of a Derby favourite
more closely watched and canvassed. A mine
may look well, or be in a bad way, and all the
men crowd around Wheal This and Wheal That
as though her breath were perfumed, and then
turn their backs upon her when old age and
wrinkles come, and her "eyes are picked out,"
and she's neglected, and left to grow dropsical,
and pass from memory. Sometimes a pet Wheal
over-runs the constable, and ruins all her lovers,
and then no secret is made of her wicked little
ways; but no professional beauty is more run
after and talked about when she's in her prime.</p>

<p>Guy was relieved to find that the Gulf Stream
was not held responsible for tin. We had heard
so much of the Gulf Stream, how it made the
'taties grow, and the flowers bloom, and the air
warm, and the wind cool, and the skies blue, and
the rain wet; but no one here said it had anything
to do with the making of tin. You may
stream for tin, but that is only one way of getting
it; and the Gulf Stream doesn't come in, and
there are tin crystals in streams, but this is a
detail known mostly to natives.</p>

<p>Miners call themselves "Cousin Jacks," and
a Cornish miner in any part of the universe
answers to "Cousin Jack." The Bookworm
tried to find the origin of the name from a man
"tending the engine" at a mine, who replied,
"S'poase Adam gave it out when he named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
t'other animals." This was a good beginning.
The men change their clothes in the engineroom;
they call it "shifting," and a shift is worth
the trouble, for a miner coming up from the
bowels of the earth with a bit of tallow candle in
his cap looks a clay-gnome of bad character, and
gentle manners only increase prejudice, for why
should such a forbidding-looking animal be
gentle?</p>

<p>He was not in the least surprised to see us,
but when he had shifted, we were surprised to
see him. He was no longer gnome, but man,
and good at that. Was there anything we would
like to see or hear about? He was entirely at
our disposal. He showed us crystals of pure
tin, colourless, and flashing like diamonds. He
supposed that tin might be manufactured the
same as diamonds, but wasn't sure, and thought
that Nature must have taken a lot of trouble
when making tin. Would not be surprised if the
pressure of the two seas had much to do with it.
It was very singular that Cornwall was the
richest spot in the universe in tin stone. There
was plenty of tin elsewhere, but not Cornish
tin, oh, dear, no! Tin was known in the days
of Moses, and where could it have come from
but here? As a commercial commodity, tin
certainly first came from Cornwall, and so, first of
all, brought Britain under the influence of the
older civilizations. Cæsar no more discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Britain than Columbus America, and Cornish
miners were gentlemen in manners, and hospitable
in the days of Diodorus Siculus, who
attributed their advance in civilization to their
frequent intercourse with Greeks and Ph&oelig;nicians.
It was on record that a Ph&oelig;nician merchant,
finding that he was followed, ran his ship ashore
rather than let another into the secret of getting
tin. Mr. Chamberlain could have done no better,
could he?</p>

<p>Mining was a science now, more or less exact,
and very exacting. We were in the centre of a
great school of mines, and students came here
from all parts to learn their business and get
diplomas. He told us something of superstitions
common to miners. Science explains everything,
of course; but can't get rid of old beliefs in a
hurry. A mine's reputation was sometimes her
weak point, just like a fine lady's, and when it
was blown upon, then, good-day and good-bye!
Get a chat, when you can, with an underground
mine captain.</p>

<p>South Africa is a sort of outlying farm for
the mining division, and when things are brisk
every mail brings twenty or thirty thousand
pounds sterling for wives and families and the
old folks at home. Every market night is an
object-lesson in political economy. When the
Boer War was on, most of the shops were in
mourning, and people went about with hunger in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
their eyes. Cousin Jack goes abroad to make
money, and what he saves he sends home. On
his return his delight is to get a wheelbarrow
farm, and come into Redruth market, and talk
tin. Cousin Jack likes to come home to die and
be buried. He's like a Chinaman in his love for
native dust.</p>

<p>Some Cornishmen live where they are born,
but, as a rule, they drift to all quarters of the
world, and look longingly homewards, like the
Jew towards Jerusalem. The most conservative
of all men is the fisher, whose little all can be put
on board his boat, and who is seldom far from
the smoke of his own chimney. The miners are
restless, and always ready to strike their tent
and march. Only, wherever they go overseas,
their children are Cornish&mdash;the saints and piskies,
the nuggies and buccas, are all drummed into
them, and there's no sun so bright, no sea so
blue, no air so soft in all the world, as in the dear
old county which they "belong" to, and shall see
one day. There spring up melodies in the little
hearts over the seas, until they are Cornish in
every beat and throb. A youngster was posting
a letter in Sydney, New South Wales, and a
friend of the family asked, "Where's that letter
going, sonnie?" "Home." "Where's home?"
"Why, Cornwall, to be sure."<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> Outside of itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the county has a large population containing a
goodly percentage of the salt of the earth.</p>

<p>Redruth is under the shadow of Carn Brea,
the home of paleolithic man. The "Castle"
doesn't count for much now the Druids have been
played out. The Bookworm told us that enough
rubbish had been written about the Druids to
build a respectable beacon fire, and what was
worth preserving would go in a watch-pocket.
However, there is Carn Brea, and those who
wish to see the Druids' altars may, without let or
hindrance. The Carn looks over the mines, and
you may see the sea on the north and the sea on
the south, winking like two eyes of heavenly
blue. The guide-books recommend a clear day
for preference. It is said that underneath this
bare and poverty-looking ridge of rocks there is
mineral wealth enough to buy up King Solomon's
mines. It's nice to know that the riches of the
world are under one's feet, and all poor people
on the tramp who like the sensation can have it
here free of charge. In fact, there is no charge
for anything&mdash;you may drink at the holy wells,
visit the churches, see the antiquities, go down
the mines, walk through museums, and "do"
everything with a smile and a civil tongue. No
charge; tip as you please. A cheerful giver has
his reward.</p>

<p>It was somewhere under the shadow of Carn
Brea that "Baron Munchausen" was born in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
lively brain of one Rudolph Eric Rasp, a fugitive
Hanoverian, at one time Assay-master and store-keeper
at Dolcoath Mine. Herr Rasp, Professor
of Archæology, and Curator of the Museum at
Cassel, and member of the Royal Society,
England, appropriated some precious medals
under his charge, and skipped. He hadn't learnt
the tenth commandment properly, and forgot the
eighth. People in places of trust are better
educated now, but this was one hundred and fifty
years ago. The Bookworm told us that Baron
Munchausen was a real man, and Herr Rasp
wrote his wonderful "adventures." No one
knows the house in which Herr Rasp lived, but
the Bookworm insisted on looking at every cottage
and barn with the touch of antiquity upon
it, within a radius of three miles from Dolcoath.
He liked to do it, and was satisfied. The invention
of coal gas as an illuminant took place at
Redruth, and a tablet commemorating the discovery
is actually placed outside the house in
which William Murdoch, the inventor, lived.
Murdoch was not a Cornishman, hence the tablet.
The Bookworm touched the walls of the house,
the door-handle, and the knocker, but we didn't
see that anything special came of it. Camborne
is also in the mining division, and has wider
streets and fewer shops than Redruth; but, then,
it has gone in for brains, and young men wishful
to learn mining come here now, and go through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
a course of lectures in class-rooms, and go underground
and work. "The Oxford of mining
students" is Camborne, only the students live
where they like, and have latch-keys. Joshua
Cristall was born here, so also was Richard
Trevithick, the first to apply steam to locomotives.
We did not see any public monument
to either.</p>

<p>The people in this division are "Weslums,"
and great on chapels, but "fall from grace" when
there is a political election. It is sad, but politics
stir up the old Adam worse than a drop in the
price of tin. Candidates for parliamentary honours
are only accepted by insurance offices at extra-risk
premiums. Guy intends going in for Parliament
one day, and studied the matter on the
spot. He thinks he knows a softer place.</p>

<p>A good deal of woman-labour is employed in
mines. They are the bal-maidens, and work on
the dressing-floors. Work agrees with them, and
Professor Sandow wouldn't find much room for
developing the muscles of a bal-maiden. We
saw some at work from the train, and heard them
singing. We saw others nearer, and they were
singing also. It's just part of the business to
sing, and more hymns are sung over Cornish tin
than over all the rest of the minerals raised in the
world. One girl starts singing, and the rest join
in; and very sweet singing it is when heard in
the open. The surface men catch on, and there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
just sweet harmony, whilst the stamps are
dancing, and the great bob is going up and down,
pumping out water. Nothing stops when the
orchestra is in full swing. The men generally
sing, too, when going and coming, and they like
a hymn with a good, rousing march tune. After
the night and early morning shifts, the hills and
valleys are tuneful, and people hearing know
what hour it is, as the shifts are regular. There
are four shifts in the twenty-four hours. A shift
is called a "coor."</p>

The</span> man in soft felt hat, and brown
canvas bag slung across his side,
with wicked-looking little hammer-head
peeping out, is a common
object. Specimens enough
have been taken out of the county
to metal a turnpike road, and yet the scientific
stone-man comes and tumbles over the refuse-heaps
once again, and chips little bits on his own
account, and carries them off. To find sermons
in stones is his reward, and there are sermons
enough, in all conscience, in a county which is
mostly stone, or something harder. When a man
of science in a soft felt hat is missing, the first
idea is that he's fallen down an old mine shaft,
and that his stone treasures have taken him
safely to the bottom, a hundred fathoms or so
under water. It is well to beware of one's steps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and not to take short cuts in the dark across
moors and downs which are honeycombed.</p>

<p>We were told we might amuse ourselves by
turning over the rubbish-heaps, and, for reward,
pick up a few specimens of ore,&mdash;no one would
interfere with us; and we might wander at will in
and about the ruins of square towers and "count-houses,"
which people fancy, at first sight, are
baronial castles in ruins. They are ruins, right
enough, and the money sunk in the engine shafts
would have built castles and pyramids. These
ruins look best at a distance, with big bundles of
broom shivering and rotting in sunshine and
storm. There is something weird and uncanny
about the look of these ruins, with broom-bundles,
like black things of misfortune, hung about them.
The Bookworm said that broom was a sign or
symbol of bad luck. We didn't find fortunes in
turning over stones on rubble-heaps, and only
secured a few tin and mundic and copper specimens
of no value to the owner. Guy said they
would look swagger when labelled, "Tin found
on Scatmoor, Cornwall." The beginnings of a
museum were in his pockets, he said, when they
began to bulge out.</p>

<p>There were some small houses scattered
about, and every house was in a garden. None
were empty; but as all the mines around were
idle, we began to wonder what the population
lived on. There must be work somewhere, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
a long way off, we thought; so far, indeed, that
the men would tire morning and night when
going and coming. The houses were low, two-storied
dwellings, built of moor-stone, and roofed
with thick turves kept in place by flat, heavy
stones. The people we saw were mostly aged,
or women with young children.</p>

<p>We came across an old fellow sitting on a big
stone, blinking with watery eyes at an old ruined
mine engine-house. He made us welcome, and
offered us the whole of the stone he was sitting
on; but we squatted on the turf, and let the
green lizards run over us&mdash;we said we liked it
like that. Very soon we were interested in the
old boy, who told us he was Jim Tregedga, the
son of Jim Tregedga before him, and he cited
Tregedgas sufficient to reach back to the days of
the Deluge. The house he lived in he built
himself "out of coor," that is to say, in spare
time, and he fenced in the bit of garden, ditto.
It was moor land, and no one said him nay, so he
took what he wanted, and the rest did the same.
All the houses were built like that, and every
man his own landlord. All the mines around
were working then, and at every shift hundreds
of young men poured out of these stone hives
and went to work underground or upon "grass."
And all the maidens rose early and went to work
upon the dressing-floors, singing like thrushes.
The mine was the soul of the moor, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
pumps and stamps its music. The young men
now are spread over South Africa and Australia,
South America and the regions of Klondike;
and the old people and young wives and children
were left at home, dependent for daily bread
upon the love of kindred whom they might never
see again.</p>

<p>Things were so different in the old days,
when Cousin Jack was full of money, and spent
it like a king, and then went to work again with
a good heart, and always ready to kiss the
maidens, or "wrassle" and break a head on paydays.
In fact, Cousin Jack wouldn't go home
without a fight, unless he was poorly. This old
man knew the names of all the mines round
about, and their histories; when they "cut rich,"
and when they "cut out" and were shut down,
and the broom hoisted to tell all the world that
another bal had gone wrong.</p>

</div>

<p>Every mine had its own particular spirit,
or family of spirits, called "nuggies." Every
household was brought up in a firm faith in
nuggies, and the good or bad fortune of a mine
depended on the temper of the nuggies. Men
working on "tribute" were very careful not to
offend the spirits of the mine, and they had to be
careful, or they would earn little, and were sometimes
lucky to reach grass alive. These spirits
had underground workshops, wherein they worked
upon silver anvils, and the walls sparkled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
crystals of pure tin and virgin silver. These
workshops were called "parlours," and, as they
were not always willing to be disturbed, they
misled the miners, making them believe that the
tinkling upon the silver anvils was in the very
opposite direction:&mdash;such was their power. Or
they would cease working altogether, and then
the men would become disheartened, and say the
nuggies had forsook the bal, and she might as
well be "knacked" at once, for all the profit she
would yield. But the nuggies were good to poor
tributers sometimes, after they had been working
for weeks and months on starvation wages.
Months and months of work and no sound
through the gloomy corridors but the tap, tap,
of the steel-edged tools, and the fall of rock,
barren and unprofitable; and then, all at once,
the music on the silver anvils, and falling water,
indicating the presence of the precious lode. If
a man worked underground he was bound to
believe in nuggies; and if he did not believe, and
said so, then he was sure to be punished, for the
nuggies had a way of leading men into trouble.
A favourite way was to hide danger from a man
until he was on the brink of it, and then, if
stubborn and would not take warning, they'd let
him fall over a precipice, or down an old shaft,
and be heard of no more in the land of the living.
What they gave, they gave freely, and took no
toll&mdash;they wanted none, all the minerals in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
universe belonging to the nuggie family; only
they would have men civil, and civility brought
rich rewards.</p>

<p>The talk was rambling, and Guy put many
questions. Had deponent ever seen a nuggie?
Well, he believed he had. He was working on
Wheal Rose, first coor by night, and he saw a
flash at the end of the stope, and Jan Trebilcock
slapped his hand over his (deponent's) mouth so
that he shouldn't screech. That was a nuggie
going into his parlour, and Jan Trebilcock
followed the lead and came upon a lode as rich
as King Solomon's mines whilst it lasted. And
he'd heard old men say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But Guy wouldn't have hearsay. Then deponent
said he had heard the tinkling upon silver
anvils, and beautiful it was, like the melody of
church bells on a summer eve. The nuggies
always took their anvils with them when they
gave up possession of a workshop&mdash;they were
wanted elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Provoking," said Guy. "Whenever we get
very near to something it vanishes in this land of
piskies and fairies and other enchantments."</p>

<p>A little lizard crawling over Guy turned
brilliant colours, which, the old miner observing,
said there was a "thunder planet" passing, and
wished us to come into his cottage. We had
wandered five miles, but thought we could return
before the storm burst, in which, however, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
were mistaken, for we had hardly trotted a couple
of miles when it burst with sub-tropical fury.
Had it been night, the sight would have been
splendid; but we had to dart for cover into a
man's house, like three drowned rats. There was
no ceremony about our entrance, and none was
wanted. An old man and woman were the only
occupants, and they made us welcome, but our
clothes stuck to us. We drank some hot tea and
ate the remains of our pasties to the accompaniment
of celestial artillery, which put to shame the
battle of Mukden. Still it poured, and the
cottage trembled sometimes when the thunder
was loudest. The two old people were quite
tranquil, and the only apparent trouble they had
in the world was our wet clothes. The little
rivulets which ran from us were dried up, but
might be traced on the stone floor, making zigzag
courses towards the door.</p>

<p>Then came the old man's hour for reading a
Psalm, and he opened the "big book" without
any apparent thought of strangers being present.</p>

<p>"'Th' Loard es ma sheper; I shall not waant'&mdash;no
fath, I shaant.</p>

<p>"'He maaketh me to lie down en green
pastures'&mdash;ez, that 'e do, th' precious dear."</p>

<p>And so, until he finished, and shut the book.
"Now we will zay a few words, for th' dear
Loard is with us;" and without more to do, he
went down upon his knees and spread out his hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
and his face shone. If there was a soul in happiness
in the universe, it was this one; and he did
not forget the strangers under his roof. "Ef'm
be out in th' wilderness, Loard, guide'm like a
good sheper; and ef'm be cauld, warm 'em en
Thy buzum, and turn 'em out to lie down en
green pastures."</p>

<p>The rain stopped suddenly, and the thunder
grew more distant, and the lightning less vivid,
and when we were once more upon the downs
a strange feeling crept over us.</p>

<p>"I never thought I should have found myself
kneeling in a miner's hut, saying my prayers,"
said Guy. "This would just have suited Softie
Smith, who's in Orders now&mdash;going to be a
bishop, or something. At school, Softie was
always longer at his devotions than the rest, and
we used to shy things at him to remind him that
the dormitory was waiting. Sometimes the boys
made extra good shots at Softie and got him
waxy; and one night he suddenly rose from his
knees, shouting, 'Amen-who-shied-that-boot?'
It was a shout, by Jove! and the captain on his
rounds heard it; but we were little angels when
he came to us, and Softie got a wigging for
making a row. After that we dropped the
'Softie,' and re-named him 'Amen-who-shied-that-boot?'
which will sound splendidly when he's
a bishop. 'My lord Amen-who-shied-that-boot,
from Lower Egypt, then addressed the meeting,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
will look well in the papers. The name'll push
him on in the world, and that he'll owe to us."</p>

<p>The Bookworm wouldn't be drawn, and we
walked, one on each side of him, until we reached
the road, and then kept to it carefully, to avoid
tumbling down some old, disused mine shaft.
He gave our hands an extra grip before retiring,
saying, "I shall never forget."</p>

<p>"I hope the little beggar isn't going to be ill,"
said Guy. "I don't like a fellow to talk solemnly,
and grip your hands, and all that, after he's been
wet to the skin."</p>

<p>But no harm came of it.</p>

A pick</span> and shovel brigade, with or
without hats, might do some
good work on the north coast,
where the sand has buried towns
and churches. People speak of
places having been "drowned in
sand," which they certainly were. The sands of
Hayle, like those of great deserts, shift with
storm and tempest, and have encroached from
century to century. The sand-hills are called
"towans" at Hayle, and very weary walking we
found it in places where coarse, fibrous grasses
have not covered the surface. What splendid
results might follow the efforts of a pick and
shovel brigade from Perran to Newquay! Two
churches are known to have been buried at Perranporth,
and one at Gwithian, near Hayle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
These have been discovered, so there is no
mistake about them, and they are said to be
the earliest Christian monuments visible in
Britain. There isn't much to see now. There
was an oratory at St. Gwithian, and the altar
was built into a cowshed. Guy said it did not
seem that people cared very much for antiquities
until they were destroyed, or belonged to some
other country, like Egypt, for example.</p>

<p>The fine, dry sands here are splendid preservatives,
and the Bookworm became enamoured
of his idea of a pick and shovel brigade undertaking
scientific exploration. Why not? There
were exploration societies in Italy and Greece,
and why not in Cornwall, wherein there is a lost
history and a lost language to recover? Guy
was sure that lots of fellows would put in a few
weeks' digging and sifting and sorting if somebody
would only take the matter in hand in a
business-like way. If legend can be believed,
there is at Crantock a Cornish Pompeii waiting
to be uncovered. The ancient Crantock was reputed
to have been a large and important sea-port
with seven churches, and the place was literally
"drowned" in a deluge of sand, brought upon
the wings of the wind. The buried chronicles of
Crantock (all in the Cornish language, of course)
would be a splendid discovery. The present
church was allowed to fall into decay, but is one
of the show-churches in the north, and is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
famous for the newspaper crusade against hatless
women fingering their prayer-books within its
walls. The "living" is said to be worth eighteen
shillings per week. Fat livings do not abound&mdash;"a
house, a glebe, a pound a day" does not fall
to the lot of all parsons hereabout.</p>

<p>The Bookworm remarked that his Satanic
Majesty was not held responsible for sand-storms,
although Hell's mouth was on this coast. His
Majesty is familiarly known as "Old Artful;"
and people speak of one another as "artful" by
way of compliment. There is at present a good
deal of confusion in the stories told about Old
Artful and his doings in this part of the world.
It is said that he never crossed the Tamar, and
the question may only be answered satisfactorily
when spirits are summoned from the vasty deep
and examined before a royal commission. The
Bookworm took the matter in hand, with the
following results in favour of Old Artful's
presence:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the Ph&oelig;nicians traded here for tin,
Old Artful set up a smelting-house, and taught
the tinners some tricks, which they afterwards
improved on.</p>

<p>That St. Michael drove him away, and, out of
pure spite, he cursed the blackberry, which is not
now eaten after St. Michael's Day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;"><a id="i287"></a>
<img src="images/i_287.jpg" width="394" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">"One day the devil, having nothing to do,<br /> Built a great hedge from Lerrin to Looe."</div>
</div>

<p>That when visiting "Cheese-wring" he saw
an old woman making a conger pie, and inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
what she put inside, and the old woman, smelling
brimstone, said, "If you don't take yourself off
pretty quick, I'll clap you inside, and then we
shall have a devilled pie," which threat so alarmed
him that he gave a hop, skip, and jump, and
landed at Devil's Point in the sister county.</p>

<p>That Old Artful had a turn for housekeeping,
and was pretty much at home at the Lizard, and
left behind as memorials his "frying-pan" at
Cadgwith and his "bellows" at Kynance. Then
he had a post-office, the earliest on record, and
no end of "devil's footsteps," "ovens," and
"caves" are to be found in the peninsula.</p>

<p>That Old Artful, finding himself lonely and
amongst the out-of-works, built a stone fence
about seven miles in length, hence the couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One day the devil, having nothing to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built a great hedge from Lerrin to Looe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And very good workmanship it was, for it is
still there. In this way the problem of employing
the unemployed was solved.</p>

<p>That Old Artful took a great interest in the
building of churches, sometimes altering the
architect's plans, and sometimes choosing a site.
Whenever a church is built in an inconvenient
place, it is said that Old Artful would have it
there and nowhere else, and paintings on the
walls often recorded the fact, showing him removing
at night the courses which the masons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
laid down during the day. Many of these paintings
were whitewashed by pious Covenanters,
but little bits have been restored. It is said that
St. Mewan wanted a high tower to his church,
and there was a battle-royal between him and
Old Artful, who prevailed. The "cloven hoof"
may be seen on a stone gate-post, a very short
distance from the church. At Towednack, near
St. Ives, Old Artful would not allow pinnacles
to be put to the church tower.</p>

<p>That at Ladock Old Artful changed himself
into a raven, and made an inspection of the
church tower; but the babies brought to be
christened made such a row that he flew
away.</p>

<p>"How can all these things have happened if
Old Artful never crossed the Tamar?" asked
the Bookworm, triumphantly.</p>

<p>Sailors say that Old Artful was never able
to learn navigation properly, or find his sea-legs
on board ship; and there is an idea that he does
not take kindly to blue water, and was never
able to swim. It is well known that Lloyd's
underwriters will not insure a ship with Old Artful
on board. He never interferes with the building
of a ship, or does anything but provide a "locker"&mdash;called
"Davy Jones's locker"&mdash;where poor
Jack rigs himself out before dancing with the
mermaids on "Fiddlers' Green."</p>

<p>Guy came to the conclusion that the Cornish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
climate was too restful for "sabbathless, restless
Satan," who is never supposed elsewhere to be
happy except in the wearing, tearing, raging,
whirligig of pleasure and vice. Hence the idea
of his not crossing the Tamar.</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">
Newquay</span> is in Cornwall without
being Cornish, and is one of the
few towns which has no "saint"
belonging to it. Most of the
towns in the peninsula date back
to the days of saints and giants,
and then crystallize somehow. Newquay didn't
grow that way, and was content to remain until
quite recently the habitation of a score of fisher
families, who lived by beach-combing and
pilchard-seining. If the town of to-day were
wiped out, there would remain the old fish-cellars,
a few weather-beaten cottages, and the
"Huer's hut" on the Headland. Newquay town
is a modern creation, and lies between Padstow
and St. Ives, which are rich in saints and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
antiquities, and stand apart and distinct from
everything modern, crystallizing around and
about, but receiving little of the old life and
tones. The original name of the place was
Towan Blistra, which sounds genuine. The
growth of Newquay is no miracle. People who
went there for their health got better, and then
the "faculty" said, "Try Newquay;" then the
Great Western Railway took up the cry, and
shouted, "Try Newquay;" and that's all the
process.</p>

<p>The sea and rocks, and sands and caves, are
all genuine. The fine hotels are fine hotels, and
fine hotels after their style are new in this part
of the world. The houses have a hurried, built-by-contract
look about them, and the whole
place wants to be built over again, and built
differently. Most of the inhabitants now are
Cornish in a transition state, so you don't know
quite where you are. The hotel porter was
regal; the man in charge of the lift was imported
with the machine, and when asked, said he
thought a "piskie" was a new crank, or something
like that, for working the lift. Newquay
is like that now. You go there for the air, and
you get it until every nerve is braced, and you
get rid of the dismals, and eat and drink and
sleep, until you find that the one pleasure of life
is living, simply that. Even Cornish people
come to Newquay to be toned. The Bookworm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
lost his restlessness at night entirely here, and
no longer read strange books in his sleep.</p>

<p>If you want to talk with a real Newquay
man, you will find him on the Headland, looking
at the sea. We scraped acquaintance with one
watching his nets dry on the grass. He told
us he hadn't heard about piskies lately. When
he was a boy, and fish was cured in the old
cellars, and the Headland was the Headland,
and no mistake about it, and when a fisherman
was a fisherman, and everything was as it ought
to be, and had been from time "back along,"
why, then, there were piskies, of course. Everything
was different now, and he would not be
surprised if piskies were never heard of any
more. Guy said gently that that might be a
good thing, but the man ironed out all intelligence
from his face and said nothing. He did
not wish to have old memories stirred just then.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;"><a id="i294"></a>
<img src="images/i_295.jpg" width="387" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">NEWQUAY</div>
</div>

<p>The old men wandering about the Headland
always looked seaward when talked to, as though
they were sure of the sea, and the rocks, and the
beaches; all else, round and about, was slipping
from them&mdash;new houses, new streets, crowds of
people in strange garments, and such faces!
worn and wisht! why did they pitch upon this
place? Guy said these old grumblers were very
ungrateful. A fine town had sprung up, money
poured into the place, and nothing was taken
from it, and the old boys were not thankful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
The Bookworm took the side of the native, and
said no one liked the place which he called his
own, and had grown to love, to be transformed
by strange hands so suddenly. What did the
ancient Briton think of the Roman villa with
tesselated floors, and hot and cold baths, and
clothes mended on the while-you-wait system?
Much better, no doubt, than British huts and
blue paint, but not to the native taste. A diet
of Chablis and oysters disagreed at first with a
stomach used to whelks and gingerbeer.</p>

<p>Variety is one of the attractions of the county.
For a tourist who rides a bike or a motor, the
variety is perpetual, and he must pull up even
now and again and ask himself what has become
of the last sensation. If you can rely upon
your legs, you had best walk from village to
village until you are where you wish to be. To
lose one's self is an advantage sometimes; and
you can't go very far wrong. When at Newquay,
breathing in the Atlantic on the north,
you are only twenty miles from your friends
breathing in the soft airs of the sunny south.
The tramp across the country, from north to
south, is simply delicious. First of all, there are
the moors, springy to the foot, restful to the
eye, and the "coombes" running seawards and
catching sunbeams, so that you get opposing
lines of light and shadow, and charm everywhere.</p>

<p>We made our way from Newquay to Roche,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
one of the portals to the land of the white men&mdash;a
wonderful land, producing the white clay
which is shipped to all quarters of the globe.
The heathen Chinee has found it out, and buys
it in lumps. At first, he used to buy it by the
yard in his calico. The Lancashire merchant
bought the white clay and worked it into his
inferior cotton goods, and John Chinaman paid
extra for the loaded yarn. The heathen learnt
the secret in the course of time, imported the
clay, loaded his own yarn, and put the profit into
his own pocket. Then the "Yellow peril" was
talked about.</p>

<p>All the white patches in the hills and valleys
visible from here spell "kaolin," or "china clay,"
and everything that china clay touches is white;
white waggons piled up with square white blocks
travel along white, dusty roads, drawn by white-powdered
horses, driven by men as white as
ghosts in the last stages of galloping consumption.</p>

<p>"Fish, tin, and copper," was the old commercial
toast; but china clay has come in and
taken a front seat. It is only a hundred and
fifty years ago since a long-nosed Quaker found
out that the stuff was good for pottery; and then
chemists came in and found there was money in
it for manufacturers of cotton and paper; and
now the society beauty may have the satisfaction
of knowing that her fair cheek is made fairer still
by honest china clay most delicately perfumed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
The men and women who handle the clay get
the same stuff for nothing, and do well enough
without the perfume. China clay, being a modern
industry in this land of ancients, has no piskie, or
nuggie, or bucca connected with it, and Guy
took kindly to it on that account, saying it
represented the practical, hard-headed twentieth
century. Who would buy Cornwall for its
legends, he would like to know! Whereas all
the world was buying mountains of china clay.
He supposed if this long-nosed old Quaker had
lived a thousand or two years ago he would have
been turned into a piskie, and a fine crop of
legends would have sprung up. We failed to
trace any legend or folk-lore about china clay.
It was all modern&mdash;modern discovery, modern
uses, modern shipments; the only thing fabulous
seemed to be the inexhaustible supply and the
value of certain spots free from impurities.
One might almost fancy legend at work&mdash;the
wicked giant and the sainted virgin crumbling
into kaolin rather than be the heroine of the
romance with wedding bell accompaniment.</p>

<p>We came to a rock where there is a well
which is said to ebb and flow with the tide; only
it doesn't. The water is said to be brackish,
which it probably is; but a reverend canon, writing
on the spot, warned visitors against tasting it on
that account. All brackish water does not come
from the sea. However, this was a holy well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
once on a time, and young people even now
drop bent pins into it and wish. It is very
simple, and costs nothing. Then there is the
cell in which St. Roche lived until he died, and
then, the apartment being light and airy, and 680
feet above the sea, was occupied by successive
saints. At present the apartment is unoccupied,
but the parish is taking care of it. This is the
cell wherein the damned soul of Tregeagle tried
to find sanctuary when pursued by the fiends
from Dozmary Pool. The inhabitants of the
wild and desolate region between Roche and
Dozmary hear the hell-hounds pursuing the
shrieking soul on dark tempestuous nights, and
on Christmas Eve the hunt is said to be on a
grand scale. The inhabitants of the moors keep
indoors after dark. The story is told in&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a lot of moorland about here, and a
Cornish moor, with its poor soil and windswept
bracken, turning brown and golden before its
time, its gallant heaths struggling amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
rocks, or blooming grandly in sheltered patches,
tells its tale of hardship. There is not much to
be seen generally but rough ponies running wild,
and rabbits and wild birds innumerable. A moor
is not much of a place for a lonely man with sad
indigestion bad upon him.</p>

<p>This was our first real experience of a Cornish
moor, and we walked along gaily enough for a
time; but conversation languished, for each was
impressed in his own way by the immense void
upon the earth. Whichever way we looked, there
was nothing beyond speaking of limit to rolling
moorland&mdash;the hills were only gaunt sentinels to
a greater silence. To come from a city with
millions treading on the heels of millions, and
people in despair of getting breathing room, and
then to find one's self upon a moor, is to experience
a new sensation. Guy suddenly sent
up a shout, sprinted a hundred yards and back
again, and then wanted the Bookworm to "tuck
in his tup'ny"&mdash;the loneliness had got upon his
nerves, but he felt better after this performance.
The story of Tregeagle hunted by hell-hounds
had its origin in a locality more desolate than
this, and the Bookworm said he was convinced
that locality had much to do with the making and
colouring of myths.</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">
The</span> capital of Clayland is St.
Austell; but, as usual, nobody
is very sure about the saint. If
you say "Saintauzel" through
the nose, you may be taken for
a native. The church is in the
centre of the town, and the narrow, crooked
thoroughfares radiate from there. The town
seems to have grown as wanted, every house
pushing its neighbour towards the centre. The
wealth of Ophir in black, glittering tin is said to
underlie the town, and there is no doubt about
the tin being there, for the nuggies may be heard
working on their silver anvils, and bright lights
dance upon the surface during autumnal mists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Any tinner will tell you the meaning of these
mysterious illuminations; but the mines are not
worked now, because the hills above and around
are composed of the white clay which all the
world wants.</p>

<p>"Saintauzel" is a Friday town. Most things
are reckoned as from Friday to Friday, which is
market day, and the inhabitants put on their
Friday faces and Friday clothes. When it isn't
Friday the inhabitants delight in watching the
clay-waggons pass their shops, or in dodging
them in the narrow, crooked labyrinths called
streets. Everything gives way to the clay teams&mdash;butcher-boys
and motor-drivers screw themselves
into nothingness, or back down side-streets
when the clay-man is in view, driving his horses
in single file, all straining at their chains. An
endless procession of heavy waggons rumbles
through the narrow streets&mdash;waggons laden with
powdered clay in barrels, or with square, white,
glistening lumps uncovered; and the drivers,
stiffened up with clay, like loaded yarn, crack
their long whips and keep their teams at it.
These drivers, born upon the hills, look a race to
themselves&mdash;straight-backed, upright, and hard
as nails. The clay which they absorb year by
year doesn't hurt them. The amount which they
swallow with their pasties must be fatal to
microbes, as they seldom think of dying until
tired of throwing about barrels of clay which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
would break an ordinary labourer's heart to
handle. The old county is sent away in ships
as fast as they can carry it, but there is some left.</p>

<p>Guy fancied that there was not so much
"expression" in the faces and dramatic action
with the people we met here as in other places,
and hazarded a guess that this was a result of
looking at so much inexpressionless clay. There
is not much in clay to lay hold of the imagination,
except its whiteness, and the purer the blanker
it is; but, then, smirches in clay would cause a
sensation, like the entrance of a lady with a past
into a party of sweet young things playing at
goodness in a social comedy. There is little in
the article suggestive of anything but money.
The people here are said to be very rich in comparison
with those in other towns, and they need
three banks to take care of their cash. The
chief amusement at night is to walk around the
banks, just to see that the doors are closed.
The Bookworm made a few inquiries about
libraries and art galleries, and that sort of thing,
but there were none. He felt sad; he couldn't
help it, he said, when he found people with
money without books and pictures, and things of
that sort. Samuel Drew was born here, so also
was John William Colenso, the man who "made
an epoch in criticism by his straightforwardness,"
and there is plenty of room for a statue to each.
The old bull-ring is in evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>The hill on which the town stands stretches
away a mile or so, and the further you go the
better the view of the white, glistening patches,
and the rills of white water trickling down the
valleys seawards. "Milk!" is the one idea,
milk flowing through the land&mdash;milk enough and
to spare for all the condensed milk factories in
the world. It's only an illusion&mdash;it's clay in
solution, which by-and-by will show itself in the
sea, like a white apron upon the shore, until it
loses itself in the eternal blue. We stand here
on what is a sort of terminus of the hilly backbone
of the country&mdash;eastward, it is black and
rugged, moor and mountain with white scars, and
ruined engine-houses of abandoned mines; then
westward, and there is paradise in green stretching
towards the cathedral city. Down again to
Clayopolis and the throb of arterial life&mdash;clay
and money, money and clay.</p>

<p>China clay has no fairy of its own, like tin.
It came upon the scene too late; and fairies can't
be made at will, but must grow of themselves,
and take time. Fishing, agriculture, and mining
have their tutelar spirits, able to work and
dematerialize at will, and every desolate cave, and
cairn, and moor, and pool has its gnome and fairy;
but when we come across anything modern there
is one thing wanting. Lightning comes from
fairyland until it is put in lamps and sold per
metre. China clay, unknown to the fairies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
unblessed by the saints, has to make its own way
in the world, on merits, like any modern youngster
turned out of a Board School. And it does
very well.</p>

<p>This is one of the few towns in which a
theatrical company can pay expenses. The
people are musical and dramatic, they can't help
it; and though a "theatre" would be "taboo," a
drama in Public Rooms is all right. Sports do
very well, and you may race anything, from lame
ducks to donkeys, bikes and motors, men, women,
and children, but not horses. A horse-race is&mdash;well,
not to be mentioned.</p>

<p>The game of "hurling," peculiar to the county,
is not played here now, though it is kept up
at St. Columb and Helston and other places, and
we saw it played at Newquay in a very mild sort
of way. The origin of the game is pre-historic.
When a paleolithic gentleman had a nice bone
which another paleolithic gentleman tried to
grab, a tussle commenced, and the best man got
the bone, and kept it. The evolution of the game
out of a scrimmage for a bone is so natural that
the best-informed antiquarians have missed it.</p>

<p>A hurler should be able to run like a hare,
hide like a rabbit, leap like a kangaroo, and climb
like a monkey. Then he should be able to box
like a pugilist, wrestle like a champion, and sky
a ball like an All-England cricketer. These are
essentials. Then, if he escapes drowning, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
comes alive out of a "scrum," he may make a
good hurler. It is a fair game, and may be
played by selected teams, like football, or town
against country, with an unlimited number. A
silvered ball is the trophy. The ball is thrown
into the air, and the man catching it runs for his
goal, and when the game is too hot for him he
skies the ball, and another fellow starts with the
whole pack after him, until he's tripped up and
buried under a living heap of players; then
some one steals away with the ball, wrestles with
the first man who catches him, and then there's
another "scrum," which gives points to Rugby.
And so on, backwards and forwards, from goal
to goal, until "time" is called, or someone insured
against broken bones and sudden death manages
to touch his goal with the ball in his hand.
Carew says the game was played in his days
so that players returned home "with bloody
pates, bones broken and out of joint, and such
bruises as serve to shorten their days, <i>and
all in good play</i>, and never attorney nor coroner
troubled for the matter." If this was the legitimate
play, what could the other have been?
The game as played on Newquay sands was
quite another affair, and, if revived with "Newquay
rules," might extend from Cornwall to the
country. Porpoises play a game in the sea
something like hurling, only instead of a ball
they throw a live conger into the air, and the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
who catches dodges about until made to throw it
up again, and so on, until time is called. An
exciting game is on record, but the sensations of
the conger are unknown. A good fish story
usually leaves a trifle to the imagination.</p>

The</span> south coast differs from the
north. Lord Beaconsfield came
to Falmouth in his dandy days,
and wrote: "It is one of the
most charming places I ever saw&mdash;I
mean the scenery and around."
The scenery is still there, and the town is turning
it to account and learning to live on it. Falmouth
is very much like the lady who has seen "better
days," and is reduced to put up the sign "Lodgings
to Let." There was a time when the ships
of the King's Navy and the Mail Packets came
here, and the riches of the world were landed on
its quays. Disraeli came here <i>en route</i> for the
East, when Falmouth was queen in her own
right, if wealth and commerce and beauty can
make a queen. Then things changed and changed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
and ships and commerce found other ports; but
the beauty is there, and is all its own. Some
people say more might be made of it in a commercial
sense. There is a literary and refined
air about the place which delighted the Bookworm,
who found out the Libraries and Art
Galleries, Polytechnic and Observatory.</p>

<p>Honest John Burton was the Bookworm's
delight; and after picking up a first edition of
Chatterton in the twopenny box, there was no
keeping him away from the premises. It was a
rare pick-up, and honest John wouldn't take more
than twopence, not he! We rambled over the
premises, and found heathen gods enough stocked
away to fill a temple in Thibet. The Bookworm
said there was nothing so rich and rare in the
whole collection as old Burton himself, a dose of
whom would banish melancholy. We took his
word, for more good things were pumped into
him than he could afterwards remember.</p>

<p>Falmouth is linked in Parliamentary matrimony
with Penryn, an ancient borough so ashamed
of its age that it sold its parish stocks, and other
antiquities, "for a song." The boroughs are an
ill-assorted pair, and the political marriage was
not made in heaven.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 357px;"><a id="i315"></a>
<img src="images/i_315.jpg" width="357" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">AT FALMOUTH.</div>
</div>

<p>Falmouth has its scenery and climate, two inalienable
possessions, costing nothing, yet sources
of unsuspected wealth if only made the most of.
We came across the track of the American citizen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
John B. Bellamy, whom we met at Penzance.
He left his card with honest John Burton, with
an order to send him along any available relics
of the late King Arthur. He may get some, who
knows? He left behind him also the opinion,
that if the "durned old place" was only on the
other side of the Atlantic, the harbour might be
filled up with the gold that would flow into it
every season. Tired Yanks would find paradise,
and pay accordingly. The garden of acclimatation
speaks of the climate in the bloom and
perfume and variety of plants, all of which speak
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth.</p>

<p>There is no place in the county so well catered
for in the matter of water excursions. The river
Fal is marked as one of the beauty spots of the
county, and some compare it favourably even
with the Dart and the Wye. It may lose or
gain by comparison, but it is good enough "on
its own." The best way to see the Fal is to sail
from the open into the fjord-like inlet of Falmouth,
and then up the valley, sinuous and well-wooded,
narrowing as you go, and increasing its natural
beauty every mile. The Helford river should be
seen in a similar way&mdash;come in from the open
with the sea and fancy, if you can, the mighty
rush of waters boring its way through rocks,
carving out the miniature creeks, right and left,
until its earth-hunger is spent. The scenery from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Helford to Gweek is bolder than that of the Fal,
and some prefer it on that account. There is a
lot of fishing done in the creeks, and most of the
yachts we passed had nets and lines hanging over
the bows or lying about the decks. The oysters
have a good reputation, but there is no considerable
trade done in pearls.</p>

<p>Rivers are scarce, though the clouds are
generous. Some say there are no real rivers,
and that Cornwall has only the predominant
partner interest in the Tamar, and two brooks,
Camel and Fowey, which you can leap over anywhere
with a long pole, until you come to salt
water. The Fal and Helford are really estuaries.
The upper moorland reaches of the Camel and
Fowey abound in delicious little spots where one
can sit and listen dreamily to the stream fretting
amongst boulders, and swirling in sunshine and
shadow amongst ferns and wild flowering shrubs,
with effects incomparably beautiful.</p>

<p>The Lizard end of the peninsula is a sort of
receiving house for the news of the world. The
secrets of many lands arrive here first, breathless
and palpitating, after their long runs on the ocean
cables. Marconi has his stations here; and at
unlooked-for places we come across notices reminding
all whom it concerns not to foul the
cables. There are secrets of which we know
nothing&mdash;secrets of peace and war, ruin and success,
love and hate, which we would give our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
ears to have an inkling of, vibrating under water
and in the air.</p>

<p>The peninsula has always been a sort of
receiving office for the nation. At first, when
foes came sailing along, the Cornishmen spied
them and sent up a flare, and then the beacon
fires flashed out the news in the dark night, so
that all men might read in letters of flame. A
fire lit high on St. Michael's Mount travelled with
speed around the coasts of Britain. Hensbarrow,
called the "Archbeacon" of the county, could tell
its story in fire from the Lizard to the Tamar,
and set men's blood tingling, and hearts throbbing,
as no "wire" or "cable" or printed word can do.</p>

<p>It was "wireless," and the British admiral
keeping watch upon the French fleet at Brest
informed my lords of the Admiralty of their movements
by means of signals from frigate to frigate
stationed across the Channel, and received at the
Dodman by the sleepless watcher. Then the
news travelled by semaphore from headland to
headland&mdash;from Dodman to the Blackhead, to
the Gribben, to Polruan, to Polperro, to Maker
Heights, to the Commander-in-Chief. Very little
time was lost, even in the old days, when there
was anything to tell, and Cornwall was the eye,
and ear, and tongue.</p>

<p>The Dodman, the highest headland in the
county, is one of those places of solitude where
depression will not stay. Hour after hour one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
may pass upon the bluff headland without seeing
a human soul or hearing a human voice, and yet
feel one's spirits elated in the silence. With a
mere half-turn of the head one can see the whole
Cornish coast, from the Lizard to the Rame, and
beyond, and all the ocean traffic passing up and
down. Then below, a sheer fall of four hundred
feet, are the little crabbing boats, mere specks
upon the blue, shoaling into green and breaking
into foam upon the dark, weathered rocks. And
then the wind, blow which way it will, must sweep
this headland, bringing with it the scents of
heather and wild flower untainted, as though in
all the world there were no such things as smoke,
and factories, and areas of pollution. For miles
the cliffs are covered with tall bracken, green in
summer, but quickly touched with brown and
gold. These cliffs teem with life which we cannot
see but know to be there; but feathered life
is abundant and everywhere in evidence, flying
in air, clustering on the rocks, or diving and
swimming when fish abound. And then there
come up from the shore the rhythmic sounds of
spent energy&mdash;</p>

<p>Every sense is filled with thrills, and depression
is impossible. People say the country is one vast
sanatorium; and I think that open-air treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
on the Dodman would be delightful. The
"faculty" are welcome to the hint.</p>

<p>The headland is occupied only by a small
shelter for the coastguardsmen, and a modern
granite cross, which can be seen, soon after passing
the Lizard, by persons on board ship. To
those who think it, this fine monument is the
symbol of the new life rampant over a buried
past, for it stands on the legendary playground of
the giants, who laid waste the whole district, and
heaped the bones of their victims, pile upon pile,
until the headland rose majestic.</p>

<p>A giant once dwelt here who willed his
"quoits" to his relatives, who, however, never
claimed them, so they became part and parcel of
the lord's inheritance and may be seen to this day.
Then footsteps of the Vikings are plainly visible
in stone encampments, telling of another age, still
violent, but of "derring-do;" and to the west we
touch Arthurian romance once more, for Geraint
of the Round Table lies there, interred with
Christian rites in a boat of gold, which was rowed
across the sea with silver oars. All this, and
more, within sight and sound of the Dodman
cross, bearing the following inscription: "In the
firm hope of the Second Coming of Our Lord
Jesus Christ, and for the encouragement of those
who strive to serve Him, this Cross is erected.
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1896." The old order and the new rest
peacefully on this headland solitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>The finest beaches on the south are here,
right and left of the Dodman, and are seldom
visited save by stragglers, like ourselves, or
picnic parties from a distance. The Bookworm
chanced upon the fact that Cornwall had some
little share in the production of Lord Byron, his
grandmother being a Trevanion of Caerhays, only
a short distance from here.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> Admiral Byron,
the grandfather, was known to contemporaries as
"Foul-weather Jack," so storm-pursued was he,
and the poet's passionate love of the sea was not
a mere "sport," after all.</p>

The</span> coastguard station, with whitewashed
walls gleaming and flagstaff
with halyards all taut, makes
a good mark along this coast,
which is certainly not thickly
populated now, to judge by the
number of crumbling houses and villages partially
deserted. The fishing coves hold their own, but
the cry of "back to the land" has not been much
heeded in these parts.</p>

<p>The man in blue uniform, with spy-glass
under his arm, is always an attractive personage;
he is so human, though official; so fresh and
breezy, so ready to help the passing ship in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
danger, and do grand deeds in storm and tempest.
England's watchfulness and strength is writ large
upon the coastguard station, and the men are
uniformly intelligent and good-mannered. A
strange mixture of blood&mdash;Great Britain in
epitome&mdash;may be found in one small station we
halted at, namely, two Irish, one Scotch, one
Novocastrian, and one Devonian&mdash;not a dash of
Cornish blood at a Cornish station. A native
might wink the other eye if his own flesh and
blood did a bit of free trading in spirits and
tobacco, and only run with his "two left legs"
after a culprit related to himself. The men,
as a rule, have seen the world, read a great
deal, and pass their time in thinking&mdash;not very
much else to do when on duty but watch and
think.</p>

<p>If you'll be good enough to listen, the coast-guardsman
will talk. The sea-gulls are very
chummy with the men, know the uniform, and
like to come and help them in their garden
patches. Guy told a man one day that the gulls
were a bit out of favour just now with Londoners
because they had a weakness for sparrows, feathers
and all; but the coastguard wasn't surprised at
the gull, only at the sparrow. He thought that
London sparrows were too artful to be picked up
in that way by a simple sea bird. He told us
some stories about sea-gulls. They are fond of
young kittens and puppies that nobody wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and throws into the water. The fur increases
the luxury of the <i>bonne bouche</i>. Then rabbits.
Woe to the young thing that they tap with their
powerful bills! A gull will kill a rabbit caught
in a gin and feast on its eyes. Then they are
famous poachers, stealing the eggs of birds nesting
in the cliffs, and carrying off the newly hatched.
But ravens and crows take reprisals and make
the gull sorry at times. Our coastguard told us
this little story:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was a gull sitting on a rock below
this station, and I watched the pair day by day.
The male bird is very attentive, and feeds the
hen, and watches over her, and takes her place
on the nest when she takes an airing. A pair of
ravens took an interest in the proceedings, and
one day, when the male bird was away foraging,
they executed a scheme for robbing the sea-gull's
eggs. It was very neat in its way. The ravens
flew round and round the sitting hen, screaming
defiance; but the hen only sat the tighter. Then
they circled closer and closer, and flapped their
black wings in the hen's face. This insult was
too much. The gull's blood was up, and she
rose from her nest. Then the ravens separated,
and whilst the gull chased number one, number
two picked up an egg in its bill and flew back to
quarters, where number one joined it, and the
two shared the stolen egg. Some people say
birds have no reason. Well, I'd like to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
cunning strategy better carried out. The little
Japs couldn't do better."</p>

<p>The silver-grey gull is in paradise in the fishing
villages, and takes possession of the boats,
and quays, and roofs of houses, and helps itself
out of the "flaskets" filled with fish, or from the
heaps lying on the stones. A bigger thief does
not live and escape punishment. If anything
floats on the water in the harbour, the gull swoops
down upon it and it is gone; if anything is left
unprotected, the gull has it. What a gull will eat,
and want no liver pill, would make any other
respectable bird on the wing bilious; but the
gull is always bright and cheerful, and ready for
another gorge, and its natural store of gastric
juice would set up a chemical factory. When
fish is scarce the gull goes inland and feeds upon
the fields, or joins the noble army of poachers
over gentlemen's preserves.</p>

<p>On the wing the gull is the spirit of poetry,
and in storm the spirit of the tempest; the fishers
look on it as a friend, because it hovers over the
"schools" of fish swimming in the sea, and warns
them of approaching storm. The gull is the link
between the fisher and his home, flies after the
boats when they go out, and heralds their return.
The women look out of their windows in the early
morn, and see the gull resting and waiting for the
offal to be thrown away when the boats land their
catches. Then they know the boats are near,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
and that the men will be home soon, with fish
strung upon their fingers for the morning meal.
The gull is the household bird by adoption, and
the women don't begrudge it what it steals.</p>

<p>The dark rocks outside the fishing towns
swarm with sea-gulls&mdash;specketty-brown gulls,
grey and white gulls with ebony-tipped wings,
gulls with brown and gulls with yellow beaks,
gulls flying, gulls swimming, gulls sleeping, gulls
on outpost duty. Without these birds the rocks
would be very tame. A swarm of gulls in the air
is one of the prettiest sights in nature; and then
the cry of the gull is the cry of a human soul in
agony, which perhaps it is.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Legend of St. Goeland.</span></p>

<p>In the days when Lyonesse was land, a poor
hermit dwelt upon a rock, whereon he had built
for himself a chapel, which was but a shelter of
rude stones to protect him, but it was called a
"chapel" because it had been signed with the
sign of the cross, and he said his prayers therein.
The rock was storm-swept, and was at the head
of a bay, beautiful in summer, but terrible in
winter, and the bay was only a trap to poor
mariners, and every rock could tell its tragedy.
St. Goeland was a Breton, born in a fishing
village, and when he came across there flew after
him a sea-gull, which he had befriended. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
all the same to the sea-bird where it dwelt if the
sea was but there, and the bird wished to be with
St. Goeland.</p>

<p>The rock on which the saint built his chapel
was known as the Gull Rock, and there was
nothing living visible but solemn shags resting by
night, and sea-birds on the wing at all times; no
human dwelling or habitation disturbed the pious
meditations of the saint, who feasted when snails
were in season, and on Fridays fresh fish was
always brought to him by his devoted gull. At
other times the gull brought sea-birds' eggs,
and laid them down outside the chapel door.
Fresh sea-birds' eggs are simply delicious when
boiled.</p>

<p>St. Goeland did not live a useless life, for outside
his chapel there was a cage which he filled
with dry sticks, lighting it when there was fog
about, and then hoisting it aloft to warn mariners
to keep clear of the treacherous bay. "St.
Goeland's lantern" became known, far and wide.
One day the saint picked up a bell which had
been washed ashore; so he built a rude belfry
and hung it, and then "St. Goeland's Bell" was
heard by mariners at sea whenever there was
danger of being caught upon a lee shore. When
the wind veered round to danger point the old
gull used to give the saint a note of warning, and
the saint would rise from his soundest sleep and
pull on the rope, so the sound of the bell was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
carried down the wind, and mariners gave the
treacherous coast a wide berth. The saint never
knew the good he did, but did it, not knowing.
Now, what with cutting and stacking faggots for
the "lantern," and ringing the bell, St. Goeland
was sometimes very busy, and he and his gull
grew old together. The silver-grey feathers were
almost as white as the saint's silver hair. When
the saint was troubled he talked to the bird, which
was saddened when he said, "We have grown
old together, and what will happen to the poor
mariners when there is no one to light the lantern
and sound the bell?"</p>

<img src="images/i_329.jpg" width="380" height="588" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ST. GOELAND AND THE SEAGULL.</div>
</div>

<p>It came to pass that a ship filled with pilgrims
was making for the land, and would have come
and anchored in the bay when the wind veered,
and the old gull gave its note of warning; but
St. Goeland was too feeble to rise, and the tears
came into his eyes. The pilgrim ship was sailing
joyously towards destruction, and the bell was
silent! The gull cried louder; the wind rose,
and the ship was on her way; soon she would
be on a lee shore, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>St Goeland made a supreme effort, and
clutched the rope. "My God!" he shrieked, and
fell, and the bell sounded. But the gull heard the
shriek and the bell's note mingled, and carried it
against the wind; and those on board the pilgrim
ship heard, and drew off the land, saying, it was
"St. Goeland's warning," which it was, only they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
did not know that the saint passed away when the
bell pealed his requiem.</p>

<p>From that time the sea-gull's cry is that of a
human soul in agony mingled with the note of a
"passing bell." All mariners, and fishers, and
dwellers by the sea, know it well, and woe to
the man who lays finger on a gull, except in
kindness!</p>

<p>"The sea-gull," said Guy, "is an utterly unproductive
animal, fit for nothing but to look at.
What it destroys is incalculable, and yet some
yarn like this, invented Heaven knows when,
makes it almost a sacred bird."</p>

<p>The Bookworm had little to say, except that
people were more influenced by sentiment than
they knew or suspected.</p>

<p>Guy pooh-poohed "sentiment," and said he'd
wring a couple of gulls' necks the next morning
before breakfast.</p>

<p>He went out with that idea, but a warning
voice reached him. Then he tried to "negociate"
a purchase, and a big fist brought down in the
man's palm warned him that the transaction was,
in diplomatic language, "delicate." Guy owned
up that there was something, after all, in "sentiment."</p>

<p>Sea-gulls are privileged in this part of the
world.</p>

Fishing</span> villages look charming
from the sea, the houses rising
one above another against the
hills, with green fields and windswept
trees for background; and
they are very picturesque when
looked upon from hilltops, with all their boats
riding to their moorings, or sailing about in the
offing. This is the home of the pilchard in
summer and autumn, and the industry is important.
When confectioned in oil, and tinned, the
pilchard is "sardine." One of the most beautiful
sights on the coast is the united fleets from
Mevagissey, Polperro, and Looe, "drifting" on
a clear, dark night, with their riding-lights
twinkling. So peaceful, and not a sound reaches
the shore, for deep-sea fishing is a silent occupation.
Fish are supposed to be very sensitive to
sounds, and it is one of the deadly sins to whistle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
or sing on board a boat when her nets are in the
water. These places live for the most part on
Wesley and pilchards. Speak well of both, and
you may be happy.</p>

<p>Pickled pilchards are exported to Italy in
casks; and the abusers of the Pope and all his
works wax fat. The man who ventures to say a
good word for his Holiness needs courage; but
those who make faces now would feel bad without
Lent and fish days in the Roman calendar.
Guy argued that it showed a fine spirit to feed
poor benighted Italians who crossed themselves,
and pouch a hundred thousand sterling a year
for the trouble. Pickled pilchards he looked on
as a bond of union between the two countries.
Pilchards feed bodies, the Pope souls, and the
shekels come here. Long live the pilchard!
Commerce is the fifth gospel, and Rashleigh
puts it in a nutshell&mdash;Father Prout couldn't do

<p>The incense of fish, fried and grilled, ascends
to high heaven, or as far as it can reach in that
direction, morning and evening; and when there's
no incense times are hard. The sign is said to
be infallible.</p>

<p>Pilgrims sometimes fancy that fish is cheap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
where it is caught, but this is one of the fallacies of
the day. Soles go to Billingsgate when they die,
and so do most fish of good table reputation. A
visitor may sometimes secure a sole when landed,
but only the millionaire class can do so often.
The Bookworm tried the experiment, and Guy
told him he should have known better; but he
was carried away with excitement at seeing a
real live sole flap its fins and gape. People
standing around told him the fish was alive, but
would be iced with the rest, and sent to Billingsgate.
The Bookworm thought he would like to
buy it, and there was a sudden lull in the business
going on on the quay. The sole belonged to a
man in a blue flannel shirt, and every one crowded
round and stared at him, and listened attentively
when he was asked to name a price. The man
seemed sorry to part with the fish in this way,
and then he asked a price which might have
affected the price of "stocks" had it been reported.
The Bookworm brought home his capture in
triumph. Guy studied the question afterwards,
and found that the people liked to pack fish in ice,
and pay cartage, and railway charges, and commissions,
and make bad debts, all for the honour
of selling fish at Billingsgate at a lower price than
they would sell it on the spot. "The nearer the
sea the further from fish," is the working motto,
but it loses its strangeness after a time.</p>

<p>Fisher people eat fish, but prefer flesh at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
midday meal. We found the man in a blue
flannel shirt sitting on a post, smoking a short
clay as black as ebony, and he told us that his
boy Tom wouldn't even ask a blessing on "no
vish" when it was served for dinner. "I shaan't
ask no blessing over no vish, nor nothing but
butchers maate," says young Tom; and the man
in the blue shirt told us he thought this thankless
spirit resulted from too much schooling!</p>

<p>A deep-sea fisher, with a boat of his own, is
the most independent man in the universe, having
no landlord, paying no rent, burdened with no
tax on boat and gear, going and coming as he
pleases. He reaps without sowing, and is "protected"
within the three-mile limit by gunboats
in a land of "free trade." A blue-water fisher is
not ashamed of his calling, hiding himself under
the title of "artist" in shrimps, or "purveyor" of
lobsters, or "merchant" in mackerel, and the rest.
A fisherman, honest fisherman, is not too proud
to be called what he is. The art of fishing is as
old as humanity, and it has been discovered that
a fish diet can produce a great nation in the Far
East.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
Guy wanted to know why fishers are always
called "poor," and why sentimental tears were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
shed over their hard lot? Fish cost nothing to
feed, yet fetch about twice as much as beef and
mutton for the table, and so somebody made a
good thing if the fisherman was poor. If the
calling was a hard one, one must go to some
other part of the world to discover it; and as for
danger, cases of drowning at sea here are very
rare. The moan of the "Three Fishers" doesn't
suit the part in this place.</p>

<div class="caption">THREE MINUTES WITH A DOG-FISH.<br /><i> The net is cut by the spines on the dorsal fins.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Fish "charms" are comparatively rare, but
fish oil is said to be good for weak vision, and the
smoke from burning fish is a protection against
evil spirits. The eating of skate accounts for
large families, and a dogfish secures an heir
male, if eaten in the month of May. Kings and
queens, and all persons worried on this subject,
please note.</p>

<p>The curative effects of sea-water drunk fasting
are believed in. Some of the old people say
they have never taken any other medicine. A
master mariner told us that, at sea, sailors would
drink sea-water instead of coming to him for a
dose of "traade" out of the medicine-chest. The
Bookworm said a medical journal had recently
drawn attention to the subject, and recommended
it to people who rose bad-tempered in the morning.
Certainly the ocean wouldn't miss a few
bucketfuls, and mothers-in-law and M.P.'s, studying
the questions of the day, might go in strongly
for the ocean cure. What a sweet-tempered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
world to live in then, and plenty of water for
fish to swim in left!</p>

<p>A deep-sea fisher has a good eye for colour,
and every shade and tint upon the face of the
sea and heavens he knows as well as any artist.
Fish colours he knows to a shade of a shade, and
when the sky has a queer look, he likens it to
"mackerel" tints, and every tint is an omen to him.</p>

<p>How many hours a day a fisherman passes
looking at the sea has never been counted. There
is, perhaps, some unknown fascination for eye and
ear, something calling which will not be denied.
We noticed an old man who seemed glued to a
stump in a nice sunny corner, out of the way of
the wind, and the old man took possession of it.
The view from this post was seaward, of course,
and when the old man wasn't gazing at the sea
and clouds, he took off his sou'wester and looked
inside of that. Sometimes he put something
inside his sou'wester, and then took something
out and popped it in his mouth. The lining of
his sou'wester was his storehouse of unexhausted
tobacco-quids. This was "Uncle Tom" and
"Uncle Tom's post," and the men, in passing,
would hail him, "How ar'ee to-day, Uncle Tom?"
to which he would reply, "Toll-loll." It wasn't
much, but Guy, taking it as evidence that he
could speak, laid in a stock of black, rank Irish
roll tobacco, fit for chewing, and scraped an acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Did he ever tire of looking at the sea? Not
that he was aweer on. The vish was in the zay,
an' th' wind was in the clouds, and what else was
there in this world worth looking at? Man and
boy, he had followed the sea till his hair was
white, until he knew its coquetries and passions,
and generation after generation before him were
sailor-fishers, until "the salt was in his blood."
The old man's eyes were wild-violet-blue, and a
mystic light came into them when he said that at
times the sea "called" to him, and "ef zo be I
had my way, I'd die at zay, and be buried in salt
watter, like Jan Tregose."</p>

<p>Guy paid court to the old sea-dog, until his
sou'wester was full of fresh quids, and wormed
out the story of Jan Tregose, who, it appeared,
was one of the good old sort in the good old
times, who could sing a song, and swear a swear,
and loved a fiddle, and a maid, and brandy-toddy
with the best. Now, when Jan found his timbers
so shaken that he had to take to his bed, a longing
came over him to die at sea, and be buried in
deep water. The sea-spirit came to him in his
dreams&mdash;the same spirit, tall and diaphanous,
that used to come to him when a young man and
tell him what was going on at home whilst he
was on his voyages. The sea-spirit had not
troubled him since he had remained ashore, until
now, and it was a sign to him.</p>

<p>Jan Tregose called his sons together, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
made them swear that never, whilst breath was
in them, should he be laid in a coffin, or buried
in the earth. Then the sea-spirit came again,
and told him that when the tide turned that night
she would receive him. The old man called his
sons again, and they carried him on board their
lugger, and sailed away in the calm night, with
the stars alone for witnesses. The spare lugsail
was spread over the nets, and upon it Jan lay,
his long, thin white hair gently lifting in the
breeze; and there was nothing heard but the
sea-splash against the boat, and nothing seen but
a long-necked gannet on the wing.</p>

<p>The boat was far enough from land when the
tide turned. The sons looked, and there was a
mist before their eyes, but it went "like a flash,"
and the old man lay stark. Then the sons knew
it was the sea-spirit they had seen as mist.</p>

<p>The sons kept their oath, and wrapped their
father in the old lugsail, and watched him disappear
in thirty fathoms of water, ten miles from
the Stone. And many a man has declared that
he has heard Jan Tregose fiddling and singing
before a storm. Those who are wise put back
when they hear "Jan's tune" at sea, for there is
"sartin to be a coose time."</p>

<p>"The salt is in the blood of these children of
the sea, and has developed a strange mysticism,"
said the Bookworm. "Of course, I don't understand
it," he added quickly, seeing Guy brace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
himself up and put on his cross-examining air.
"It's there all the same, and the sea has voices
and prophecies for them which we landsmen miss;
and why not? The sea is as a human face to
them, and they know when it is troubled with
the spirit of passionate unrest. It may be that,
like the fishes, they have a sixth sense, and can
see dark shadows fluttering under cloudless skies,
and hear voices from afar preluding passionate
symphonies."</p>

<p>"These fellows are always looking on the
sea, and no doubt spot things before we should.
Wonder if they didn't; but why this high-falutin?"
asked Guy.</p>

<p>"It may be magnetic phenomena, and these
men unconsciously receive messages; but it is
none the less mystical to me," said the Bookworm,

<p>"I see; kind of receiving officers to the Clerk
of the Weather. The newspapers will come out
with this sort of thing in the near future: 'Our
special correspondent writes that a change may
be expected soon&mdash;he feels it in the marrow of
his bones;' or, 'Our infallible predicter at the
Land's End heard sea-voices last night, and recommends
umbrellas and mackintoshes for the
next week.' Take out a patent in time and
make a fortune; ideas are money just now," rejoined
Guy, holding out the red flag.</p>

<p>The Bookworm was provokingly unconscious.</p>

Cornwall</span> has a fascination for
artists, and it is said that Newlyn
and St. Ives have many more
reputations to make. On the
south coast, where studios are
few, we often saw artists of the
unflinching, realistic school painting directly from
Nature, their models standing patiently enough
in exposed places. And such models! There
are grand heads and faces among these fisher-folk,
and one can get models for saints or Vikings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
A collection of sketches made between Polperro
and the Dodman was shown us, which would do
splendidly for every character in a Passion-play.
Judas was there, who would, and did, receive his
pieces of silver before sitting for his "effigy" to
be drawn. He looked the part to perfection.
And the sketches of women were splendid also,
which is not remarkable, as they possess, in these
parts, much of the languorous grace of their
Southern sisters, the eyes being incomparably
beautiful.</p>

<p>The sea is the mother of life and beauty, and
that is why Venus rose from the waves. The
birthplace of the goddess might have been here,
long ago, when the short, stiff galleys of Greek
and Ph&oelig;nician rowed along the coast, marvelling
at its beauty, after the pulseless shores of the
tideless Mediterranean. Here were the dark
cliffs and the sapphire waters falling on the golden
sands. And in the early morn a soft, diaphanous
mist was borne onwards by the breakers, so those
who saw said, loveliness rose from the foam, and
they called the vision Aphrodite&mdash;the awakening
of Nature into beauty. The mariners took the
vision home, and Aphrodite, the life and movement
of the sea, became the guardian of mariners&mdash;the
morning and the evening star.</p>

<p>The Beach is the shy maiden, seeking always
the shadow of rocks and cliffs, and running into
caves to hide from the light of day, when adorning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
herself with sea-shells, and rainbow medusæ,
and deep-tinted anemones, and all the treasures
which the ardent sea casts into her lap. And the
Sea is the wooer, restless and masterful, wooing
ever and in every mood, and making his lovesong
in sweet lullaby, and plaintive moan, and
martial beat as of ten thousand drums heralding
the march of grand battalions.</p>

<p>When you see a girl in a boat you may write
her down "stranger," and if you see her handling
a pair of sculls, you may be sure of it.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> The
mothers of the blue-water men have as little as
possible to do with the sea, and are content to
admire its greens and blues shot with flaming
sky tints, and dream of "heavenly costumes" in
like shades, at so much halfpenny per yard. Strong
prejudices exist in places against women having
anything to do with boats; but custom differs
greatly on the north and south coasts as to what
a woman may or may not do, when the men
come ashore. That women and cats, hares and
rabbits, bring "bad luck" is a very general superstition;
so a woman never goes out with her
husband fishing, and seldom steps into a rowboat.
Where public sentiment is weak, and they
can if they like, they don't like; and, in places,
the art of making and mending nets is entirely
lost to the women, though formerly, to make and
mend nets, of all sizes, was a part of every girl's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
technical education; and in a fisher's family her
fingers were never idle in making good the rents
made by rocks and the sharp teeth of the voracious
dogfish.</p>

<p>Guy said it was probably the fault of the men
that the women left their boats and gear alone.
On rivers and lakes, where girls were encouraged,
they took to boating like anything, and if there
was a prettier picture than a girl sculling, or a
girl eight, he'd like to see it. The men had no
doubt frightened the women in the course of
centuries with stories of sea-monsters and fairies,
and no wonder they threw over net making and
mending at the earliest moment.</p>

<p>The sea has its "bucca," just as the land has
its piskie, and there is the same uncertainty as to
the origin of the one as of the other. We picked
up a story, and the Bookworm called it</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Romance of a Bucca.</span></p>

<p>It is known to all fishermen living at the
Cove, and fishing with crab-pots, long lines,
spilters, and drag-nets, that Bucca could bring
good luck or bad luck just as he was minded, but
that he never interfered with any man who owned
a big boat, or went far away to sea with drift-nets
for the capture of pilchard, herrings, and mackerel,
in their season. Bucca did not move with the
times, and got out of the way of great trawlers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
and craft worked by steam and motors, churning
up the sea when it was restful, and defying wind
and tide; but was content to lord it over those
who went in and out in little boats, and left him
his share of "luck" upon the beach, when they
landed. The fisherman often saw him, when the
water was clear, working in and out amongst the
crabs and lobsters, half-hidden with sea-weeds;
and it was always counted as good luck to see
Bucca at work, because he who saw was sure to
have a fine catch. Sometimes he was seen, when
the mists rolled up, sitting amongst the shags
upon the rocks, holding court amongst them, and
the noise which the birds made was taken for
song, so the fishermen of the Cove called the
mist "music," and they say to one another that
the "music" is coming off the land, when the
mist is rising and rolling away in clouds.</p>

<p>Bucca was not always Bucca, but a young
prince who loved a maid, "tall as a lyllye refreshed
by a showere," but, alas! shut up in a convent to
be out of his reach. Then he grew desperate,
and bribed a "wise woman" to change him into
a pigeon, so that he could come and go, and the
maiden took the pigeon into her cell, and hid it
in her bosom. The prince won the maiden's
heart, and she grew more lovely and contented,
which was her undoing, for the Lady Superior
thought something must be wrong when a maiden
under her charge was happy; so she sent secretly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
to the holy monk living near by, who caught the
pigeon in the cell, and loosened the spell of the
"wise woman," when the prince stood confessed
the maiden's lover in his human shape. The
maiden clung to him, and he was bold and used
bold threats, so the doors flew wide open, and
they would have fled, but the holy monk cursed
him with a curse, and turned him into a Bucca
for a thousand years, or until such time as he
should win woman's love.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;"><a id="i349"></a>
<img src="images/i_349.jpg" width="339" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE FIGUREHEAD OF THE "CALEDONIA," MORWENSTOW.</div>
</div>

<p>A Bucca is not fair to see, being human but
in form, with a dark face, like weather-beaten
rock, and big head with tangled masses of fine
seaweed for hair; but he has power to change
at will into fish or bird, though not into anything
with a human soul. So when the maiden looked
upon the prince, she shrank from a thing so
loathsome, and he rushed down the nearest cliff
and into the sea, and sought companionship with
fishes, until he learnt the ways of a Bucca, and
could exercise dominion in his new element. He
could neither drown in the sea, nor die upon
land, for a thousand years, or until such time as
he might win woman's love.</p>

<p>The prince became Bucca of a cove wherein
there were but few dwellers, and the fishermen
became accustomed to see him sitting amongst
the seaweed, and on the rocks amongst the sea-birds,
and noticed that he was always sad and
lonely, so they had compassion in their hearts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
and spoke him fair. Bucca rewarded them by
filling their crab and lobster pots, in season, and
driving the fish into their nets; and when a storm
arose he'd lift their little craft over the waves,
and guide them home in safety in the thickest
fog. Generation after generation came and went;
and the little children heard of Bucca, and what
he could do for those who spoke him fair, and of
the terrible things which happened to those who
mocked him because of his dark skin, and big
head, and seaweed curls. People who treated
him badly he punished by driving the crabs and
lobsters from their pots, and the fishes from their
nets, and would let them drown in storms.</p>

<p>One of the Cove fishers was Uncle Malachi,
who, when he was old, was left with a little maid,
a grandchild, to bring up; and he took her in
his boat with him, teaching her all he knew.
People laughed, and said it was unlucky to have
a maid on board a boat; and it seemed so, for
Uncle Malachi went out and returned with empty
pots and nets. One day the little maid fell into
the sea, but Bucca held her up until Uncle
Malachi reached his gaff, and gaffed her in.
From that day he never wanted luck when he
took his little maid with him; and "Malachi's
luck" became a saying in the Cove for a good
catch.</p>

<p>For centuries the Bucca lived at the Cove,
lording it over fishes and fishermen, and never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
thought to cut short the term of his punishment
by winning woman's love; but when he held up
the little maid in the sea until Uncle Malachi
gaffed her, an idea came into his head, and his
heart throbbed.</p>

<p>The little maid grew beautiful and her lovers
were many, but she gave her love to Seth Barton,
who was as dark as she was fair, and passionate
as he was dark, and none of the fisher-lads dared
so much as lift their eyes to Uncle Malachi's
little maid when he was near. Seth was a
crabber, and took over all the old man's pots and
gear and boat when he was laid to rest, and he
was married to the little maid, and they lived in
the old house with the windows looking on the
beach. In the linhay at the back Seth placed
all his gear wanting mending, and Grace was
deft with the "needle," having been taught by
Malachi to make nets and mend them, to bait
the long lines, and do all that a boy might do on
the boat or on shore. Only Seth would not take
Grace out with him, for there was a saying, "A
woman in a boat is a devil afloat," and he was a
fisher, and feared bad luck if a married woman
put foot over the gunwale.</p>

<p>Now, when Seth Barton was at sea, Bucca
would come into the linhay and make and mend
the nets and gear, so that Grace had little to do.
By-and-by she grew accustomed to Bucca, who
came and went as he pleased; and when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
pleased no one could see him, so it was no good
for Grace to shut the door and say he should not
come. Bucca, in fact, was often with her when
she did not know it, and in her dreams she was
wooed by a handsome young prince, who took
her thoughts from Seth, and filled her with
passionate longings, so she was never so happy
as when asleep and dreaming dreams. When
she awoke there was only Bucca with his seaweed
hair and ugliness, so she had no idea that the
lover of her dreams was Bucca, the prince of
olden days, when the soul of a man beamed in
his eyes. In time, the sight of the ugly Bucca
grew distasteful, and she would rather mend the
nets and bait the hooks than have him about
with his flat fishy eyes, in which no human light
beamed. And Seth, when he heard of the
visions, grew jealous; and Grace held her peace,
but was rude to Bucca, telling him, in scorn, that
if he were but as her dream-lover, she'd follow
him over sea and land.</p>

<p>Then Bucca knew he'd never win woman's
love, and he must abide his thousand years.</p>

<p>One night, however, Grace dreamt a dream,
in which her prince-lover pressed her lips and
eyes, and whispered softly, so that she rose in
sleep and followed the vision, which passed over
the sea. She unmoored Seth's boat and took the
oars, but Bucca was there, and lifted their weight,
and drew back the waves that scarcely touched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
so that the boat travelled fast, and Grace still
slept. When the boat was far from land the
vision changed, and the prince became a Bucca,
who knelt before her, his sea-locks dripping,
imploring for a woman's love to restore him to
his lost estate. There was pity in her soul, and
the fishes swam round and round the boat to
witness the strange wooing, and wonder what
would happen if their Bucca won a woman's love.
The night was dark, and the stars shone, so that
the sea was jewelled. Grace, under the enchantment
of a spell, lifted Bucca's head and looked
into his eyes, but they were poor and flat, with
no light in them like the light in the eyes of
men.</p>

<p>Then she took fear and awoke, and the spell
was broken.</p>

<p>The men of the Cove heard a woman's scream,
and rushed down to the beach, where Seth was
looking for his boat. Afar off, a mere speck,
they saw a woman rowing, but the boat glided
over the sea impelled by invisible power, and
when its keel grated on the sand, the men saw
Bucca leave the stern, and disappear.</p>

<p>The fishers praised Bucca for bringing the
boat to shore in safety; only Grace knew, and
kept her secret, as a Cornish woman can, until
she grew old, and then she told it to her children.</p>

<p>Those who have the right sort of eyes may
see the Bucca, whose thousand years of doom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
are running out, and no woman's love has come
to shorten it. But the little boats are disappearing
from the Cove, and big boats go to and fro,
churning up the blue water, and sounding steam
whistles, and Bucca has told the sea-birds and all
the fishes, the crabs and the lobsters, that when
he disappears there will be none to rule over
them.</p>

<p>The Cove maidens are not taught to row and
handle boats, and you may go there and never
see a woman touch a boat or mend a net, for
fear that Bucca may take a fancy to them, and
"slock" them out to sea. And they don't need
the warning twice.</p>

The</span> "good" King Arthur left some
tracks, on the north coast mostly.
We heard nothing of him on the
south. Tennyson followed the
northern trail, and we followed
Tennyson, for a while; and we
started in comfort, which any one may do
now the Tintagel hotel is running. The King
himself was never so well accommodated on
the spot. The Arthur zone is somewhat limited
for mere holiday pilgrims. The Lyonesse is out
of it now, so the area is about from Bude to
Camelford, and back again, following the lines of
desolation and tumuli. The anniversary of the
King's birthday is still celebrated by the ringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
of bells under the sea between Bude and Boscastle.
We didn't hear them, but some people
say they have.</p>

<p>We had a wet Sunday&mdash;a day of pitiless rain
and gloom, a day to be remembered as long as
human sensation of the dismal lasts. Everybody
took to letter-writing and addressing post-cards.
So the morning passed, and it was cheerful to
hear some one say it would be all right after
twelve&mdash;it was always all right then. We
struggled on, and still it poured. There was
some wind, but it was the rain which took
possession of us; and Guy suggested that the
Gulf Stream had gone wrong this time, and was
pouring out of the clouds. We explored the
hotel, and tried smoking and sleeping, and sleeping
and smoking, until we were awake again,
and began to take an interest in our fellow-pilgrims.</p>

<p>The Bookworm talked King Arthur in the
drawing-room when only a few were present, but
the news somehow spread through the house, and
he soon had an audience, and everybody a Tennyson
in pocket. Guy said the little beggar must
have been grinding secretly in order to surprise
us one day. The surprise came now to all who
had been reading up Tennyson with the view of
following in the footsteps of Arthur from battle-field
to battle-field, from cradle to grave, and all
within the borders of the Duchy, to find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Arthurs were plentiful, and that there was one
at least for each kingdom in Great Britain, and
one across the water. The mythical Arthur, the
historical Arthur, and the Tennysonian Arthur
were "reviewed."</p>

<p>A lady visitor in spectacles said Arthur was
her ideal. One reason&mdash;she might almost say
<i>the</i> one reason&mdash;for her coming into Cornwall
was to visit Tintagel, his birthplace, and pay
homage to his sepulchre, if she could find it.</p>

<p>Guy said her sentiments were exalted, and
sustained one on a wet Sunday. He was sorry
that he did not know as much as his learned
friend the Bookworm, but he had a sort of impression
that Arthur was not happy.</p>

<p>The lady sighed, and put all the fault upon
Queen Jenefer. Arthur was her ideal, but, alas!
he allowed the Queen to have too much of her
own way, and should have interfered when she
broke the china and threw her jewels into the
river. Guy confessed himself interested in this
free handling of the subject, and learnt the lady's
views on the subjection of women (within limitations,
of course) to the men who found them in
bread-and-butter and pocket-money.</p>

<p>A young lady interrupted conversation by
giving a recitation, and everybody pulled out
Tennyson, and read marked passages to one
another, and so the evening slipped away. Still
it rained; but we didn't mind it now, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
as we had been informed on good authority that
it always cleared after a downpour!</p>

<p>The Bookworm enjoyed himself most when
button-holed by an antiquarian, who listened
with an ear-trumpet whilst he explained that it
was of no consequence whatever whether King
Arthur ever existed, because he was an idea.
The deaf gentleman begged leave to make a
note of so original a remark; and made more
notes whilst the Bookworm aired his conviction
that Arthur represented a phase&mdash;a passing
phase&mdash;of civilization in Britain, and that the
legends which grew around his name served to
show how little society was prepared for the
higher standards of life, known well enough, but,
alas! not followed.</p>

<p>The Bookworm told a little story which, he
said, was not very well known, not having been
unearthed by the Historical MSS. Commissioners
until Tennyson had finished his great Arthurian
romances.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">King Arthur's Judgment.</span></p>

<p>The King sat in his hall with his knights,
and every one else was there who could be there
of right, and many who had no privilege wrote
to the King for tickets; the stable-boys and
scullions fought for places round the door, and
climbed the high windows and peeped through,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
for the word had gone round that the King would
hear a matrimonial cause. The King looked
troubled when he took his seat, because he had
been obliged to refuse places to so many fair
ladies who promised to lace in extra tight so as
to take up the least possible room. But accommodation
was limited, and every refusal made
him an enemy. Such is greatness; and the King
was troubled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;"><a id="i361"></a>
<img src="images/i_361.jpg" width="378" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">YSEULT AND TRISTAN.</div>
</div>

<p>But there was more trouble to come, as he
well knew, whenever he sat as President for the
trial of matrimonial causes; and his prophetic
soul told him that he would be outwitted in the
end, because there was no King's Proctor, all
ears, by his side. The case was that of Mark,
King of Cornwall, whose wife Yseult, the Helen
of the day, had been carried off by Tristan,
second to none in love and war. All the parties
were of blue blood, and the fugitives had only
yielded to the law by force of arms, so the case
was not wanting in interest for the upper crust.</p>

<p>Mark opened the proceedings by saying he
wanted his wife home again, where things were
sixes and sevens, and dinner served anyhow;
but Yseult refused to return because Mark was
bilious at times, and said bilious things much
better left unsaid, and, moreover, she liked
Tristan best, and would stick to him, for aye and
always. There was a fluttering of fans and
applause in Court, which made the President sad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
so that he threatened to have it cleared on repetition.
There were no counsel learned in the
law practising in those days before the King, so
the parties said their say and argued as they
pleased; and when Tristan sidled up to Yseult
and patted her on the back, saying, "Cheer up!"
the whole assembly hurrahed, and the King made
believe not to hear it, but turned to Jenefer, his
Queen, who whispered to Lancelot, who was a
sort of friend of the parties all round; but what
they said was not audible to the reporters.</p>

<p>The King was troubled. There were no
precedents in law for a case like this, so he made
a little speech to Mark, telling him he'd be better
without an unwilling wife; but Mark was bilious,
and extra obstinate, and would have his wife, his
whole wife, and nothing but his wife. Then
King Arthur changed his note, and tried his
cunning upon Tristan, who said love was above
law, and he'd have his love. There was, then,
nothing for the King to do but to pronounce
judgment, which he did, dividing Yseult between
the two; and the order which he made was that
she should stay with the one when the trees were
in leaf, and with the other when they were bare,
and to Mark, as husband, he gave first choice.</p>

<p>The trial was in the autumn, and Mark was
no fool, so he elected to take Yseult when trees
were bare, saying to himself, "She will come now,
and let me but get her home, and the trees will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
never be in leaf for Tristan!" But he was no
match for Yseult, who threw herself into the arms
of her lover, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There are three trees of constant hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ivy, the holly, and the yew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bear leaves summer and winter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tristan! I am thine for ever."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"A woman drove three chariots abreast
through Temple Bar that time," said Guy, laughing.
"If women practised at the bar to-day, it
would be a bit awkward for the judges, for they'd
make holes in judgments as wise as Solomon's."</p>

<p>We had a gentle reminder that it was time
for all lights to be out, and the last impression
everybody had was that the right thing to do in
Cornwall was to make a pilgrimage to Tintagel.</p>

That</span> enlightened citizen of the
United States, Mr. John B. Bellamy,
left his name, writ large,
in the visitors' book. He was
keen as ever on collecting relics
of the late King, and inquired
if the holy grail was yet on view at the castle?
King Arthur's tables, plates, and punch-bowls
not being what he wanted, he chipped some and
left the rest. The hotel clerk told us that the

<p>Sea and land and sky were deliciously clear

<p>"I don't suppose it makes much difference to

<p>A stiff climb up slippery stone steps, with
samphire growing perilously near, brought us to
the "fortress," and what there was in stone
suggested little by way of poetry or romance.
Guy had made up his mind beforehand to see
something quite different&mdash;Tintern Abbey, or
Warwick Castle, or something. But this! As
he couldn't see what he wished for, he would
see nothing; so tilted his hat over his eyes to
keep off the sun and hide disappointment. We
left him where he lay, and rambled.</p>

<p>A fine bit of rock scenery, even in Cornwall,
and worth looking at, is this. If there had only
been a tempest, and all the elements at war,
their chorus of thunders drowning the sea-birds'
cries! But to-day it was sunshine and peace, and
nothing to tell of war but sharp-pointed rocks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
landslips and slides telling their own tale, writ
large.</p>

<p>"This is the very place in which Arthur
should have been born," said the Bookworm,
when Guy, tired of his own discontent, joined us.</p>

<p>"I don't see any reason for it," said Guy.</p>

<p>"No! When Arthur first opened his eyes
upon this rock, what impression do you think he
received? This was a fit cradle for great things
in a great mind, and this man was great."</p>

<p>"Never lived at all, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I don't care. This was a fit cradle for an
allegory of war between What Is and What
Should be, and Arthur is as the light shining in
darkness."</p>

<p>"Have it your own way," said Guy; "but
wouldn't some other place do just as well?"</p>

<p>"Quite, if the first impressions of the newly
born were of eternal struggle. Arthur was born
for the world, and not for a parish."</p>

<p>"I think we'd better clear," said Guy, sharply.
"Here's the lady in specs., and the antiquarian
with the trumpet, and the whole crew. They've
all got their Tennysons, and I can't go over it
again. If the place was only a bit like it, I
wouldn't mind."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dozmary Pool is a cheerless place at its best;
it is situated in a sad-coloured region, wherein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
stones grow best, and everything that has life
struggles for existence. This is the place that
Tennyson selected for the King's death, and the
mysterious disappearance of his famous sword
"Excalibur." In Arthur's time the mere was
better worth calling a lake than now, but the
stones and barren lands and hills and general
"wishtness" of the place are pretty much the
same. The locality is marked as about one
thousand feet above sea-level, and in winter the
place is said to be more breezy than pleasant.
They have been draining the pool a bit lately,
but no trace has yet been discovered of "Excalibur"&mdash;one
day a syndicate may be formed to
dredge the mere. An arm "clothed in white
samite, mystic, beautiful," holding King Arthur's
sword with jewelled hilt, and every jewel worth
a king's ransom, would be worth a trifle, and
make the poet's reputation as an historian. Some
people are never satisfied until they can see and
handle things.</p>

<p>Guy touched the water of the silent pool,
and, finding it real, was encouraged to sit down
and discuss things in a matter-of-fact sort of way.
He said we could start with facts here, for here
was a mere, and the water was wet. Then,
there were rushes growing on the margin of the
pool, and when the wind blew, no doubt they
made rush music&mdash;sad, mournful music&mdash;a sort of
place where a fellow who had had a good licking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
in battle would come and hide, and die, if he
could, and no one to see him do it.</p>

<p>"I like this story: there's something human
about it, and it was a bit rough on Sir Bedivere
to be told to chuck away the only thing King
Arthur had got. I feel for him. Only fancy
being told to throw away the only available asset
to pay funeral expenses! It was very human
on the part of Sir Bedivere to want to keep
Excalibur, and I don't suppose that any of
Arthur's friends and next-of-kin believed him
when he said he threw it into the mere. He
said he did, and we'll let it go at that; and if it
should be dredged up one day, why, of course,
the good Sir Bedivere will leave the court
without a stain upon his character."</p>

<p>The sun was westerning; a slight breeze
ruffled the waters of the mere and the dry reeds
rustled. The Bookworm said it must have been
a fit place for a great temptation, and he was
glad that Tennyson made it appear that Sir
Bedivere was a man of honour. A chough
skimmed across the water, and the Bookworm
said this was a strange coincidence&mdash;we were
talking about King Arthur, and the very bird
which legend said his soul inhabited came upon
the scene. This was only wanted to make the
wild place a sanctuary.</p>

<p>"Nothing but legend," said Guy, quickly.
"Wherever you are in this county, its nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
but legend. You walk on legend, and just
breathe it all the time."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you never heard this one," said the
Bookworm. "There's time to tell it."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, old man," said Guy. "Another
added to the number won't count much."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">King Arthur's Chough.</span></p>

<p>Well, then, you know, said the Bookworm,
that King Arthur was married to one Jenefer
(sometimes called Guinevere, which is the same
thing), and that Merlin was present at the wedding.
Everybody was having a good time, and Merlin
slipped out and consulted the stars. He had a
monopoly in that business, and was paid special
fees by all the swagger people who wanted to
know what trouble they'd be likely to get into if
they but went the right way to work about it.
Well, Merlin slipped out of the castle, and ran
against a young gentleman singing, "The night
is clear, and I am all alone," underneath the
royal bridal chamber. "You'd better go and sing
indoors," said Merlin, making a note of the fact
that this was Launcelot, a young sprig of nobility
who thought no small beer of himself in those
days. He was an army man, and fond of poaching.
Merlin read something in the stars that
night which he told an old chough, who knew
more of the black art than any other bird. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
chough Merlin gave the King as a wedding
present. The bird was as black as a raven in
those days, and used to live so long that it was
only at its prime at a hundred years.</p>

<p>Queen Jenefer was much written about in the
chronicles of her time; and so the poets know
what she did, and what she wore, and how she
looked, and what she said at all the grand tournaments
whereat she distributed blue ribands and
prizes to knights of high degree.</p>

<p>The King was a busy man, so busy that in
the end mischief came of it, for when garden
parties and jousts and things were going on, he
was wont to say to Launcelot, his aide-de-camp
in chief: "Just you look after the Queen this
afternoon." Now this suited Launcelot full well,
for he was a born Squire of dames and a gallant
man as well as a fighter of renown. Sometimes
the King sighed when he saw his Queen riding
away gaily by the side of Launcelot; but he was
a fond husband, and it was not in his heart to say
her nay when she would a-hawking go, or watch
the young knights a-hurling for a silver ball.</p>

<p>So the habit grew as the King got busier and
busier. And though Launcelot liked more and
more to wait upon the Queen and learned to put
up with her tempers, the Queen was not happy
at home, where she had it all her own way, but
would look in the mirror and pity herself, for
that being plump and fair to look upon there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
no Arthur at hand to pinch her cheeks and tell
her so. At times she even grew weary at hearing
how good Arthur was, and would exclaim in
her tantrums&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What care I how good he be!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And to her little waiting maid she would say:
"By my faith, I could do with less goodness
abroad and more comfort at home."</p>

<p>The old chough which Merlin gave the King
was the wireless messenger between the King
and Queen, and carried messages to and fro.
Launcelot was left behind, as usual now, when the
King went on a fighting tour in Wales. He had,
however, a fit of the "blues" just then, and the
Queen put him on milk and soda and dry biscuit
diet, so he soon got well, and trouble began. They
played hide-and-seek, and found each other in the
gardens, and quarrelled and made it up again,
until the Queen had fond eyes for none but
Launcelot; and the old chough hopped about the
Court, and was kept waiting for a return message
which, when he got it, wasn't worth the carrying,
so light of love the words were. The old chough
had a friend at Court, a dwarf, who played the
fool, and skipped about like a withered leaf, and
learnt a good deal more than people wot of. One
day he tied a paper around the chough's leg,
which opened the King's eyes when he read it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
and he whispered something to the chough, which
made him turn red about the beak.</p>

<p>The King was still in Wales, and his sword
ran crimson. A council of war broke up in confusion,
all through one Murdock, a bosom friend
of Launcelot's, putting his spoke in all the King's
plans. It was Murdock's turn to sleep on the
mat outside the King's chamber, and the old
chough, acting on information received, kept his
eye on Murdock. The King was sweetly dreaming
of home and Jenefer, his Queen, when the
chough woke him.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"Come and see," croaked the chough, hopping
towards the door.</p>

<p>Then King Arthur noticed that the old chough
was crimson about the feet and legs, and great
drops of blood stained the floor, and he soon
found the reason, for the chough had slain Murdock
in his sleep, and so saved the life of the
King, as was proved by correspondence in secret
cypher found in the traitor's breast-pocket. Then
the King called all the Court together, and in
their presence knighted the chough; and from
that day the chough family have had red beaks
and legs.</p>

<p>When King Arthur died, his soul entered into
the body of Sir Chough, his old familiar and preserver,
and now, whenever he visits the scenes of
past shame and glory, it is in the body of a chough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
and that is why the Cornish would not kill a
chough in the old days, when this story was fresh
in their minds.</p>

<p>"Now the chough is protected by Act of
Parliament," said Guy.</p>

<p>"Ill-protected," replied the Bookworm. "What
Act of Parliament is so effective as a feeling of
reverence consecrated by centuries? You destroy
tradition at your own peril."</p>

<p>"All right; the story isn't bad," said Guy.
"I thought we were going to have something
tasty about Queen Jenefer and Launcelot."</p>

<p>"No, the story is only concerned with showing
how and why a black chough got a red beak
and legs, and transmitted the distinction to the
whole family of choughs. If you want the story
of the whitewashing of Jenefer, you must go to
Tennyson."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;the Queen and the little maid that
in convent did dwell. It is very nice reading,
even if you don't believe it," said Guy.</p>

<p>The popular fancy buried King Arthur in a
long mound in the Camelford district&mdash;about the
bleakest and most sterile in the county. There
is an ancient British fortification here, and here
the old people thought a fit and proper place for
the resting-place of a King for ever at war against
men and the age he lived in. But no legend
seems to have fastened on this spot as the centre
of mystic visitation by red-legged choughs, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
shadowy repentant forms of Jenefer and Launcelot,
and all those who failed to keep the oaths of
chastity and the higher life. Only here and all
around&mdash;a land of mountain, bog, and moor, bleak
and inhospitable&mdash;is a vast burial-ground of
ancient Britons in kist and tumuli, rude dwellings
and entrenchments. Here King Arthur may lie
and sleep as soundly as in the "Vale of Avalon,"
the poet's paradise for a grand soul born before
its time; but when legend is so silent, history is
doubtful in this land.</p>

<p>We reached Camelford, and at night the
piskies sealed our eyes in sleep too restful even
for the shadow of a dream.</p>

<p>"Why, gentlemen, the people of this old
country don't know a good thing when they've
got it. What is it, all of it, from the Tamar to
the Land's End? A nice little estate in size for
a cattle ranch out West, with everything on it for
making a pile. Why, gentlemen, every breath of
air is worth dollars, your skies are worth dollars,
your seas are worth dollars, all your old piskies
and saints and giants are worth dollars&mdash;just ask
John B. Bellamy to run the show.</p>

<p>"Why, gentlemen, we, in America, make
dollars; we can't help it. Then we get tired,
but must go on because we have nothing else to
do. A man may make dollars in the States faster
than he can give'm away. I know a man who
has charity-cheques signed by an electric machine,
and still his pile grows, and he says it'll pay to
give away all he possibly can now, rather than
let his heirs pay death duties, which will be quite
a sum on his little concern; for he is a small man
compared with some. These are the men who
want a place like this to come to when tired of
pile-raising. You may say, gentlemen, some other
place your side of the pond will do just as well;
but it won't. You <i>can't</i> work in this country;
John B. Bellamy has tried it. Why, gentlemen,
in the States you <i>must</i> work; and when the day
ends, you don't know you've finished, but go to
bed looking for a job; but here, there's something
in the air, and you just don't want to work, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
don't care if the whole durned sub-lunary universe
tumbles into space. That's how I feel.</p>

<p>"Just put up a big board, gentlemen, and
advertise '<span class="smcap">Cornwall to Let</span>: leases of life renewed
to men with dollar-piles and tired of trying
to be tired.' You'll have'm tumbling over in
shiploads, for it'll suit their complaint, just like
Lancashire air suits cotton. It'll just suit the
Cornish complaint for them to come, now that
'fish, tin, and copper' aren't all flourishing.</p>

<p>"I don't want to work here. I tell you
honestly, I don't want to work. When I return,
I'll tell my friends that I've located the place in
which I don't want to work; and all the gold
bugs and pile-drivers will come round and want
the receipt. I'll just tell them it's the Cornish
air, and Cornish skies, and Cornish cream, and
Cornish everything&mdash;the place where Old Nick
built churches, just for want of something to do.
That'll be a new sensation in the States for men
with piles wanting an extension of time to look
around before the next-of-kin pay the death
duties.</p>

once more to the Canary Islands in the days of Isabella the Catholic. The tale
deals with the aftermath of conquests, when "the first use the islanders made of
their newly-acquired moral code was to apply it to their rulers." The hero of the
story is the body-servant of the profligate Governor of Gomera, whose love affairs
become painfully involved with those of his master. In the course of his many
adventures we come across Queen Isabella herself, the woman to whom every man
was loyal save her own husband; and countless Spanish worthies, seamen, soldiers,
governors and priests, all real men, the makers of Empire four hundred years ago.
The book abounds in quaint sayings both of Spaniard and native, while the love-making
of the simple young hero and his child-wife weaves a pretty thread of
romance through the stirring tale of adventure.</p></div>

father. Maynard settles Thornley, but himself in his turn is "up against it." He
is arrested for complicity in the highway thefts of a glad but graceless young
ruffian. Both are sentenced to death, but a great effort is made to get them

<p>&#8258; This remarkable novel depicts in vivid word-painting the final struggle
between France and Germany, in the year 1870. The advance of the German
troops, the famous battle of Spicheren, the fearful cavalry encounter of Rezonville,
the struggle and capitulation of Strassburg are all incidents in this wonderfully
graphic narrative. A love-story runs through the book, telling of the fateful
attraction of a French officer for a German girl. As may well be imagined, the
path of their lives is beset with many obstacles, but after great tribulations they
are reunited under very pathetic circumstances. Another finely drawn character
is that of a hypersensitive gifted young musician, transformed, during these times
of stress, into a strong man of action.</p>

<p>"The Iron Year" created an extraordinary sensation in Germany. So great
was the demand for the book that twenty editions were exhausted. The German
Emperor read it aloud to the members of the Royal Family circle during the
Spring.</p></div>

<p>&#8258; The amusing adventures of Harold Blee, a youthful Eurasian, form the
main theme of this original novel. Harold is brought into contact with the two
rival factions of the local British society, and perpetrates many works of mischief,
to the discomfiture of the rich and pompous Mrs. Gladstone Mortimer and to the
suppressed amusement of her enemies. He is a most versatile boy, whose quaint
quips and irresistible antics serve a very useful purpose, when he is instrumental in

<p>&#8258; In his second novel, Evelyn Brentwood has again given us a vivid picture
of soldier life, and has again chosen for his hero a very unconventional character.
Cool and calculating, ambitious and heartless, Henry determines to climb the
social ladder by every means in his power. Articled to a solicitor when the story
opens, he is only waiting for an opportunity to follow his inclinations and enter
the army, when an accidental meeting with a duke's daughter precipitates matters,
and he immediately throws up the study of the law. Later, we follow his career
as a soldier; see how he falls under the spell of one of his senior officers in the
24th Hussars; how he wins the V. C. for the mere purpose of bringing his name
into prominence; how he is invalided home and meets Lady Violet for the second
time; and finally how he is taught, through his experience with a worthless woman,
to estimate at its true value the love of one who stands by him in the hour of
his humiliation.</p></div>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; The outstanding feature of "Hector Graeme" is the convincing picture it
gives of military life in India and South Africa, written by one who is thoroughly
acquainted with it. Hector Graeme is not the great soldier of fiction, usually
depicted by novelists, but a rather unpopular officer in the English army who
is given to strange fits of unconsciousness, during which he shows extraordinary
physic powers. He is a man as ambitious as he is unscrupulous, with the desire
but not the ability to become a Napoleon. The subject matter of the story is
unusual and the atmosphere thoroughly convincing.</p>

<p>&#8258; As will be seen from the title of its parts&mdash;"The Farm," "The Mansion,"
"The Cottage"&mdash;the characters whose passions and interests make the plot of this
story are drawn from the households of the Labourer, the Farmer and the Squire;
the book is therefore an attempt to present country life in all its important
aspects. In this, again, it differs from all other novels of the soil in our own or
perhaps in any language: its author writes not from book-knowledge or hearsay or
even observation, but from experience. He has lived what he describes, and under
the power of his realism readers will feel that they are not so much glancing
over printed pages as mixing with living men and women. But the story has
interest for others than the ordinary novel-reader. It appeals as strongly to the
many earnest minds that are now concerned with the questions of Land and
Industrial Reform. To such its very faithfulness to life will suggest answers
startling, perhaps, but certainly arresting.</p></div>

introduced to Orde, a very rich dillettante. They collaborate in a blend of comic

alas, brings them to grief. There is plenty of feminine interest in the book and
some clever sketches of "women who do things."</p>

</p>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; Fire is an Egyptian Prince and Frost is an English girl living in Florence.
The impetuous and passionate temperament of the Oriental is matched against
the steadfast rational nature of the heroine. The uncompromising desire of the
former is to make the English girl his wife, and the circumstances under which
she is reluctantly brought to consent are original but entirely convincing. Thenceforth
the struggle is on the woman's part, as she finds herself pitted against the
fierce vacillating will of her husband, and the jealous intrigues of a mercenary
little Florentine marchesa&mdash;a character brilliantly drawn&mdash;and her satellites. The
outcome of this battle of temperaments is deeply interesting. The natures of
East and West in conflict have been employed as material for fiction already,
but it can safely be said that never have the dramatic possibilities of the subject
been treated with such judgment as in this novel. The author makes full use
of her power of characterization in conveying the action of the story to the reader
with a force only to be found in the work of a really accomplished writer.</p></div>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; This is the story of a girl's life in the final years of the eighteenth century,
the background of the plot lying around Olney in the time of Cowper and Newton,
with the contrasted atmosphere of London in the days of the Prince Regent. With
all of these the heroine, Charlotte Hume, comes in contact.</p>

<p>The shadow which is cast across the plot is the outcome of a promise, given
by Howard Luttrell in his younger days to a woman of easy reputation, of whom
he soon tired, but to whom he had passed his word that whilst she lived he would
never marry. In later life he meets Charlotte Hume, with whom, almost
unconsciously, he falls in love. On awakening fully to the fact, and finding the
other woman still living, he brings the solving of the problem to the girl herself.
Luttrell is the last of a long line of men and women, who, whatever they may or
may not have done, never broke their word. The way in which Charlotte cuts the
knot most be left to the patience of the reader to find out.</p>

<p>The book does not pretend to being an historical novel, but a portrayal of
certain aspects of middle-class life some hundred or more years ago.</p></div>

<p>&#8258; This book is a departure on the part of Mr. Goring-Thomas, and is a

a mediæval fortified town in the Pas-de-Calais, and Paris. The two
heroines Toinette Moreau and Joan Dombray, both come from St. Wulphy and
both go to Paris. Their histories contrive a sharp contrast: one being by character
sweet, yielding and affectionate, while the other is combative, rebellious and
intellectual. The character drawing, as in Mr. Goring-Thomas' other books, is
notably clear and interesting. His already celebrated wit, his original humour,
and insight into character again illuminate his latest book. The history of Joan
Dombray, especially, is a strong, original, and striking piece of work.</p></div>

<p>&#8258; Lady Essendine is reluctantly compelled to divorce her unfaithful husband,
who has developed into a dipsomaniac. She is naturally distressed by the scandal
her action carries, and flies to Coddle-in-the-Dale, where she hopes to hide her
identity under the name of April Panhasard&mdash;a name chosen casually from the
titles of three novels at a railway station bookstall, "Young April," "Peter Pan,"
"The Hazard of the Die." In the quiet village she moves a sweet and gracious
figure, serenely indifferent to the curiosity of those who try to penetrate the
mystery that surrounds her. Only Boris Majendie, who poses as her cousin, is
in her confidence. Her quiet is speedily disturbed. A young American, to whom
she is strangely drawn, makes her a proposal of marriage. Boris runs more than
a little wild, although he leaves her his larger devotion. Finally her divorced
husband turns up, and she is left in an intensely compromising situation, for the
necessary six months have not yet elapsed to make the decree absolute. How she
frees herself from this curious tangle must be left for the reader to find out.</p>

<p>The book is alive with incident, but it has the rare quality of restraint, which
prevents it from ever merging into the melodramatic, and the characters are all
drawn with rare artistic skill.</p></div>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; This is an attractively told story with many outstanding features. Hugh
Inskip, a prominent man of letters, marries a young wife, whom he does not
understand, because she is continually posing and never her natural self. She
is also jealous of the beautiful but incapacitated actress, Margaret Stair, for whom
Inskip is writing a play, and makes use of an ingenious and shady trick to spy
upon her husband's motives. But Iris, the young wife, is not entirely a malignant
figure, for her frail beauty and helplessness make a tender appeal for sympathy.
The scene of the novel changes at times from the hub of London life to the
peaceful quiet of a country vicarage, whither the father of Iris&mdash;a charming
scholar&mdash;lets fall honeyed words of wisdom and advice or gently chides his over-zealous
curate. The author has a strong sense of humour, as well as a great power
of dramatic presentment.</p></div>

away to make an imprudent marriage with a very charming but rather weak young
man who is addicted to "drink." Fastidious to a degree, this failing does not
seem to spoil the gentleness and refinement of his disposition, until, enraged by an

<p class="center">With 8 Illustrations by Frank Wiles.</p>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; Mr. Locke's astonishing fertility of invention has never yet been seen to
as great advantage as in this story. It has all the picturesque bravery of the
"Beloved Vagabond," all the tender sentiment of "Marcus Ordeyne," all the
quixotic spirit of "Clementina Wing." And yet it is like none of these. Infinitely
tender, infinitely impressive, is the story of Stella Maris, the wonder child, who
has never moved from her couch, who receives her impressions of the outside
world from her gentle spirit and the gold-clad tales of her loving friends and the
secrets of the seagulls that flit so near her window. And then Stella, grown to
a woman, recovers; to take her place, not in the world of beauty she had pictured
from the stillness of her couch, but the world of men and women.</p>

<p>From the first page the reader falls under a spell. For all its wistful delicacy
of texture Mr. Locke's humanity, broad and strong, vibrates with terror just as
it soothes with its sense of peace. This is Mr. Locke's finest achievement.</p></div>

comfortable stateliness of a country house in the Old Country, and places her in a

Colonial simplicity and manliness, she also learns how to wash up dishes, and that
Australia is not all kangaroos and giant cricketers. The atmosphere of the story is
convincing, and there are many vivid pictures of Melbourne life. The book depicts
Australia as it really is, its strength and its weakness, its refinement and its
vulgarity.</p></div>

</p>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; "Beggars and Sorners" is a novel which deals with what may be called the
back-wash of the "Forty Five." It commemorates the <i>débâcle</i> of a great romance,
and in describing the lives, the struggles, the make-shifts, the intrigues and the
crimes of a small circle of Jacobite exiles in Holland between the years 1745 and
1750, it strives to show the pathos of history while revealing its seamy side. The
characters are imaginary (with one important exception); they have imaginary
names and commit imaginary actions, for the story is not confined to, but only
founded on, fact. If some readers of Jacobite history find among their number
some old friends with new faces, this need not detract from the interest of others
to whom all the characters are new&mdash;actors in a drama drawn from the novelist's
fancy. To English readers it may have to be explained what the word Sorner
means&mdash;but the story makes this sufficiently plain. The novel is of a lighter
character than those previously written by this author, and it is not without
sensational elements. In spite of adverse circumstances, grim characters, and all
the sorrows of a lost cause, it contrives to end happily. The scene is laid in
Amsterdam.</p></div>

<p>&#8258; Sekhet deals with that topic of unwearying interest to readers of romance&mdash;the

Guardian himself proves her tempter, Evarne has good reason to believe herself
one of the victims of "Sekhet," the ancient Egyptian Goddess of Love and Cruelty.
Even though the main theme of this story is the tragic outcome of a too passionate
love, portions of Evarne's experiences, such as those with the bogus Theatrical
manager, are full of humour, and throughout there is a relieving lightness of touch
in the writing. The book grows in interest as it proceeds, and the final portion&mdash;a
long duel between Evarne and the evil genius of her life&mdash;is dramatic in the
extreme. The result remains uncertain till the last page or two, and though
decidedly ghastly is entirely original and unforeseen.</p></div>

products. They are in the schoolboy stage, and we who are supposed to be

"Comus Bassington" has no father, and a mother of a very uncommon type.
After leaving school he runs loose for a time in London, bear-led a little by a
clever young M.P., falls in love with the most wonderful match of the season,
gets deeply in debt, and even when at the absolute end of his tether fascinates

<p>&#8258; This book is distinctly the outcome of the latest "intellectual" movement
in novel-writing. The hero, Hawkins, is an African explorer. During a holiday in
England he falls in love with and captivates Caroline Blackwood, a woman of
strong personality. Circumstances prevent him from entering upon a formal
engagement, and he departs again for Africa, without proposing marriage. Caroline
and Hawkins correspond fitfully for some time; but then a startling combination
of events causes Hawkins to penetrate further and further into the interior; a
native village is burned, and a report, based apparently upon fact, is circulated
of his death. Not until seven months have elapsed is he able to return to England.
He finds Caroline married to a man who has found her money useful. Here the
story, strong and moving throughout, moves steadily to the close, describing
delicately and analytically the soul conflict of a man and a woman, sundered and
separate, with a yearning for each other's love.</p></div>

<p>&#8258; A humourous story of the reappearance of a twin brother, who is supposed
to be dead. Prosperous, respected, and well satisfied with himself, a suburban
tradesman is contemplating matrimony and the realisation of his ambitions, when
the twin brother appears. He is thrown into a state of panic, for not only is
his fortune thus reduced by half and his marriage prospects endangered, but the
twin is to all appearance a disreputable character, whose existence threatens to
mar the tradesman's respectability. The good man's attempts to hide this
undesirable brother make amusing reading, and the pranks of the unwelcome twin
serve to complicate matters, for the brothers are so much alike as to be easily
mistaken one for the other. The new arrival is really a man of integrity, his
depravity being assumed as a joke. Having played the farce out he is about to
"confess," when the tables are turned upon him by accident, and he is forced to
pay heavily for his fun in a series of humiliating adventures.</p></div>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; The outstanding idea of Mr. Hugh de Sélincourt's new novel is the
possibility of absolute love and confidence between father and daughter. It is the
main thread of the story and all the incidents are subordinated to it. The book
falls naturally into three sections. The first opens with the birth of the daughter
and the death of the mother, the father's utter despair, until an idea comes to
him, to make the child his masterpiece and to see how much one human being can
mean to another. The second deals with the growth of the child from five to
fifteen. In the third, the girl becomes a woman. Her first experience of love is
unhappy and threatens to destroy the confidence between father and daughter.
But she is enabled to throw herself heart and soul into stage-work, and in the
excitement of work she finds herself again. And the end of the book leaves her
with the knowledge that one love does not necessarily displace another, and that a
second, happier love has only strengthened the bond between her father and
herself.</p></div>

anything else upon originality of outlook. It will make a direct appeal to that
public that has a taste for the unusual. There is underlying it a tone of passion,
the passion of a fantastic Richard Jefferies.</p></div>

<p>
<span class="u">TOPHAM'S FOLLY.</span> A Novel. Crown 8vo.  6/-<br />
</p>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; This novel has the curious charm of a tale that might be told to you by
your own mother or grandmother, a homeliness and simplicity which is never
overweighted by the writer's very considerable skill in presenting his story. The
scene is laid in a small town in the West Riding of Yorkshire&mdash;fortunately there
is practically no dialect. What the narrator presents to us is supposed to be the
incidents of the lives of various members of the Topham family and their kinsfolk
seen largely through the eyes of Mary Ann. Mary Ann's mother was a woman
of good family, who in her early teens eloped with her father's groom, and although
in consequence of her act she endured many hardships, she never repented it.
When Mary Ann was just growing into young womanhood she discovered an
advertisement in a newspaper enquiring for the heirs of Thomas Morton Bagster,
and pointed it out to her mother. They consult Mr. Topham, the lawyer, who
undertakes to make enquiries for them. Topham is at this time very short of
cash, and cannot complete a grand new house for himself and his family, over
whom he rules as a petty domestic tyrant. From now on the financial fortunes
of the Tophams prosper, and the house, which has begun to be known as
"Topham's Folly," is completed and occupied. And in this tempestuous household
lives Mary Ann as a humble servant&mdash;a kind of angel in a print dress. When the
youngest boy is about twenty he suddenly discovers by the purest chance the
whole fraud upon which the family fortunes have been erected. There are
innumerable side issues, every one of them fascinatingly human and delightfully
told.</p></div>

<p>
<span class="u">THE SONG OF SONGS</span> (Das Hohe Lied). Crown 8vo. 6/-
</p>

<p class="center">A new Translation by Beatrice Marshall.</p>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; The first English translation of this work, published under the title of
"The Song of Songs," proved to be too American for the taste of the British
public, and was eventually dropped. But it was felt that the work was too great
an one not to be represented in the English language, and accordingly this entirely
new translation has been made, which it is hoped will fairly represent the wonderful
original without unduly offending the susceptibilities of the British public. In
this colossal novel, Sudermann has made a searching and masterly study of feminine
frailty. The character and career of Lily Czepanck are depicted with such pitiless
power and unerring psychological insight, that the portrait would be almost
intolerable in its realism, if it were not for its touches of humour and tenderness.
In these pages too may be found some of Sudermann's most characteristic and
charming passages descriptive of country life, while his pictures of Berlin Society
in all its phases, the glimpses he gives us into what goes on beneath the tinsel,
spick and span surface of the great modern capital are drawn with Tolstoyan
vigour and colour.</p></div>

readers&mdash;as a writer of short stories of the first rank. In fact he may with justice
be termed the German Maupassant.</p></div>

Translated from the French by A. R. Allinson, M.A.</p>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; Of the newer French novelists Marcelle Tinayre is perhaps the best known.
Her work has been crowned by the French Academy, and she possesses a very large
public in Europe and in America. The story deals with a girl's love and a heroic
sacrifice dictated by love. "The Shadow of Love" is a book of extraordinary
power, uncompromising in its delineation of certain hard, some might say repulsive
facts of life, yet instinct all through with an exquisitely tender and beautiful
passion of human interest and human sympathy.</p></div>

<p>&#8258; "The Lifted Latch" is a story of strong situations. The hero is the son
of an Italian attaché and a girl of whose frailty he takes advantage. The mother
decides to hide her shame by handing the child over to a foster-mother together
with a sum of money for its maintenance. When the boy grows up he becomes by
a curious sequence of events and circumstances reunited to his parents, and a
series of plots and counterplots follow. The scene is set principally in diplomatic

<span class="u">THE LOVE DREAM.</span>      Crown 8vo.      6/-<br />
</p>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; In this book we meet some Sicilians of old lineage and considerable wealth
settled in a gloomy manor in England. The family consists of an aged and partly
demented Princess, obsessed by a monomania for revenge, her grandson, an attaché
of the Italian Embassy to the Court of St. James, and his half sister, a fascinating,
winning, wayward and fickle creature. This girl captures the heart of Lord Drury&mdash;whose
father murdered the Principe Baldassare di Monreale&mdash;son of the old Princess.
The contrast between these Southerners and their English neighbours is strongly
accentuated. Don Siorza and his half sister Donna Giacinta are no mere puppets
with Italian names; they give the reader the impression of being people the author
has met and drawn from life. The tragedy in which they are involved strikes one
as inevitable. Poor Lord Drury, in his utter inexperience, has taken a beautiful
chimæra for reality and starts in the pursuit of happiness when it was all the
time within his grasp. The love-interest never flags to the last page when the hero's
troubles come to an end. The glimpses of diplomatic circles in London are
obviously not written by an outsider.</p>

<p><i>Truth</i>&mdash;"Well constructed ... thrilling scenes and situations fit naturally
and consequently into the framework of its elaborate plot."</p></div>

<div class="bquoteads">

<p>&#8258; <i>The New Machiavelli</i> is the longest, most carefully and elaborately
constructed and most ambitious novel that Mr. Wells has yet written. It combines
much of the breadth and variety of <i>Tono-Bungay</i> with that concentrated unity
of effect which makes <i>Love and Mr. Lewisham</i>, artistically, his most satisfactory
work. It has the autobiographical form which he has already used so effectively
in <i>Tono-Bungay</i>, but this time the hero who surveys and experiences the
vicissitudes of our modern world is not a commercial adventurer but a Trinity man,
who directs very great ambitions and abilities to political ends, who is wrecked
in mid-career and driven into exile by a passionate love adventure. From his
retirement in Italy he reviews and discusses his broken life. The story he tells
opens amidst suburban surroundings, and the first book gives a series of vivid
impressions and criticisms of English public school and university life. Thence,
after an episode in Staffordshire, it passes to the world of Westminster and the
country house. The narrator recounts his relations with the varying groups and the
forces in contemporary parliamentary life and political journalism in London,
and the growth and changes in his own opinion until the emotions of his passionate
entanglement sweep the story away to its sombre and touching conclusion. In
addition to the full-length portraits of Margaret, the neglected wife&mdash;perhaps the
finest of Mr. Wells's feminine creations&mdash;Isabel Rivers, and Remington, there
are scores of sharply differentiated characters, sketched and vignetted: Remington
the father, Britten, the intriguing Baileys, the members of the Pentagram Circle,
Codger the typical don, and Mr. Evesham the Conservative leader. It is a book
to read and read again, and an enduring picture of contemporary English conditions.</p></div>

strength of character, which is apt to land him into quixotic difficulties. To him
is applied the title of I.D.B., the South African abbreviation for Illicit Diamond
Buyer. Nevertheless he is not guilty of the crime, but is trapped unconsciously
into acting as go-between. Caught red-handed by the Government authorities, he
is sentenced to three years' imprisonment because he will not purchase his
acquittal by throwing a smirch on the good name of the brother of the lady who
has won his heart. After serving his unjust sentence Myles is face to face with
ruin, and how eventually he emerges from the highways and byeways of disgrace
clean-hearted and with his hands stained by nothing more shameful than hard
work, forms the subject of a picturesque and life-pulsating romance.</p></div>
